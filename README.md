# Political Polarization Project 

A project about capturing political polarization in news coverage by Topic Modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI).



## Quick Start:

To run this project, open `client.ipynb`. This will import all the necessary modules and load pretrained models from pickle.  

The notebook provides a short plot demo for a topic search using LSI that suggests which network to watch given a particular query. For example, you can enter a query like  `stormy_daniels russia putin` and find out which network has aired more episodes that resemble the query.

The excellent `pyLDAvis` package is used to provide interactive tools for topic exploration on the two networks.
