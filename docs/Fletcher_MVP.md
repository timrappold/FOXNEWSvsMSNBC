# Project:

Political Polarization in Network News

## MVP Summary:

The goal of this project is to quantify  

- **Domain:** The question is, Where will a new guest book their first travel experience? The AirBnB data set I'll work with comes from a Kaggle competition. The idea is to use user data to predict which of 10 countries a new user is likely to pick as their first destination.

- **Data:** The data are stored in five disparate .csv tables:

  - Sean Hannity show transcripts for the last three months (at a minimum).
  - Other Fox News shows' transcript (Laura Ingraham, etc.)
  - MSNBC (or CNN) show transcripts. E.g. Rachel Madow.
  - 
  - .

  | Table | List of columns |
  | ----- | --------------- |
  |       |                 |
  |       |                 |
  |       |                 |
  |       |                 |

  **Modes of analysis**: 

  * Coupling of terms. E.g. `Trump` + `Stormy Daniels`. `Trump`+`Kysliak`. `Trump`+`Mueller`.

  **Work Flow / Pipeline**: 

  * Define a document. Could be either a paragraph in an episode, the episode itself, or the corpus of a show. Create a `document` class?

  * Create 

     

  

- **Known unknowns:** 

  

  - There are many ML models to use for this. Most of the ML tools I've seen used for this challenge I've not seen before.
