       " \"And also breaking at this hour, new questions about how all of the warning signs surrounding the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, were missed. What went wrong, and why did so many red flags go unnoticed? We're going to have a comprehensive discussion tonight. \",\n",
       " \"Also tonight in the face of unspeakable evil, violence, tragedy, people rose up to protect other people. We're going to show you heroes that saved lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \",\n",
       " \"And while politicians, the media, they're all pointing fingers, placing game, giving you the same predictable talking points, tonight, we will offer solutions. How do we protect students at schools all across the country? Answers. That is in tonight's breaking news opening monologue. \",\n",
       " 'HANNITY: We start tonight with breaking news and details about the investigation into this horrific tragic Florida high school shooting. The 19-year-old gunman Nikolas Cruz, he has now confessed to slaughtering 17 innocent people and wounding at least a dozen others. ',\n",
       " \"Cruz is also telling investigators details of the sinister attack. He shot students in the hallway. He fired into five separate classrooms and Cruz also confessed to authorities that he had extra ammunition in his backpack. We're also learning disturbing new details of missed warning signs in what is now one of the worst mass shootings in American history. All of the red flags were there but tragically, Nikolas Cruz was able to commit this heinous act. \",\n",
       " \"The FBI is, in fact, confirming tonight that in September, a YouTube user, with the name Nikolas Cruz spelled the name the same way as the shooter was reported to the bureau for writing, quote: I'm going to be a professional school shooter. \",\n",
       " 'The man who reported the comments said that the FBI visited him the following day but the bureau is saying today that it could not be determined the time, the location, and actual identity of who posted the comment. ',\n",
       " \"Our own Catherine Herridge as she noted earlier today all the FBI would have had to do is trace the IP address which is a routine practice to determine the location of the individual. For some reason, it didn't happen in this case. \",\n",
       " 'The mayor of Broward County is saying that Nikolas Cruz was being treated at a mental health clinic but stop seeking treatment more than a year ago. And authorities are describing his social media post as beyond disturbing. ',\n",
       " 'Just take a look at some of these pictures. You can see the suspect. Is he seen posing with guns and knives and even dead animals. And former classmates of Cruz say he was a loner, he was obsessed with firearms. He liked to show off pictures of all of his weapons. ',\n",
       " \"'The Miami Herald' is reporting that Cruz had been suspended for fighting and having ammunition in his backpack and Cruz was then later expelled for disciplinary reasons and was attending a school in Broward County for at risk students. Cruz also had problems at home. Both parents adopted him and his brother are dead. His mother passed away in November. \",\n",
       " \"The suspect was staying with a friend's family and there were also reports of Nikolas Cruz having ties to a Florida-based white supremacist group. But law enforcement said earlier today that they haven't seen any of those connections. We'll continue to monitor. \",\n",
       " \"What's also very troubling tonight is how students are describing their former classmate. Now, this is what they say about the shooter, Nikolas Cruz. Let's watch. \",\n",

       " 'UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He definitely had just some things a little off about him. It was just more or less that he was aggressive and quiet and shy about when he got aggressive. ',\n",

       " 'UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was a bit off. He would like curse randomly in the middle of lunch. You know, he would just like scream out random curse words. Like he always seemed a little bit off, you know. Just something was wrong with him. ',\n",
       " \"UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A lot of like crazy stuff that he did. Just not -- he got kicked out of school most of the time. Honestly people were saying it was going to be him. Joked like that saying that he would be the one to shoot up the school, but it turns out, you know, everyone predicted it.  That's crazy. \",\n",
       " '(END VIDEO CLIP)',\n",
       " 'HANNITY: Just like with other mass shooters, there were signs, there were warnings of mental, social, emotional problems. But all the pieces were never put together to prevent this tragedy from happening. And like with many other shootings and terrorist attacks, Nikolas Cruz was telegraphing his attentions all over social media. ',\n",
       " 'Aside from the obvious fact that anyone that would commit these horrible acts of evil and violence are completely deranged, the one commonality between the gunman and Parkland, Florida to Southerland, Texas, to the church in South Carolina, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech are mental health issues and mental illness. ',\n",
       " \"During an address to the nation earlier today, the president offered his deepest condolences and highlighted this issue of mental health. Let's take a look. \",\n",

And we hurt for the entire community of Parkland, Florida, that is now in shock and pain and searching for answers. To law enforcement, first responders, and teachers who responded so bravely in the face of danger, we thank you for your courage. ',\n",
       " \"We are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health. Later this month, I will be meeting with the nation's governors and attorney generals where making our schools and our children safer will be our top priority. It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference. We must actually make that difference. \",\n",

       " 'He is also, the president is, planning to visit Parkland, Florida, and offer comfort and support to the community. Details have not yet been finalized. ',\n",
       " \"Also predictably within hours, Democrats, the liberal media, they race as they always do to politicize a tragedy and try to blame, believe it or not, President Trump and Republicans. Let's take a look. \",\n",
       " '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)',\n",
       " \"MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC: Step up. Be a man, and talk about it and stop thinking about the NRA and your next campaign donation. Just stop. Everyone knows what you're doing. And it's time. \",\n",

       " '(END VIDEOTAPE)',\n",
       " \"HANNITY: This has happened with Republican administrations, under Democratic administrations. But what you see there is shameful. It's disgusting. But it's not surprising because it's so predictable. It happens every single time there is a shooting. \",\n",
       " 'Hollywood celebrities, they are all so quick to post their hateful messages, of course, aimed at the president, Republicans on Twitter. ',\n",
       " \"Let's start with Chelsea Handler, tweeting, quote: We have to elect candidates not funded by the NRA in November. We have an opportunity to elect candidates who won't allow kids to go to school and get shot. It's disgusting how many times this has happened and Republicans do nothing.  You all have blood on your hands. \",\n",

       " \"And Director Adam McKay posted. Normal person, oh my God, kids are being killed in schools, churches, concerts. Let's do something. Republican congressman, kids are being killed in schools and churches and concerts. Let's not do one single thing, #bloodonyourhands @GOP and @NRA. \",\n",
       " 'Author Stephen King writes: Broward school shooting, there will be prayers from blabbermouth Don, Pence the Grinch and their rightwing cohorts. There will be no call for any sort of sane gun regulations. ',\n",
       " \"Sadly, it is the left's solution every single time this happens. They rush to judgment. They want to point fingers and blame and use all kinds of vicious horrific, rhetoric. It never accomplishes anything. \",\n",
       " \"They shouldn't be what these tragedies are about here. You have people rolling out the same old tired talking points and political arguments. You know, liberals, they start blaming the weapon that the shooter used. In this case an AR-15. But if they want to ban AR-15s and these mad men, they will use something else. We saw that at Virginia Tech where a gunman used a pistol and killed 32 people. \",\n",
       " \"Look, let's get to solutions tonight. I have been in radio for 30 years in my life. This is now my 23rd year at the Fox News Channel. I know all of the talking points. And I know it's all just noise and it's not going to solve the problem. \",\n",
       " \"Here's the simple truth. You're not going to change people's minds with a political debate, especially as it relates to the Second Amendment. I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. My mind is not going to be changed. \",\n",
       " 'I have thought this through all these years in my life. And I doubt can I change the minds of any of these Hollywood liberals and the anti-Second Amendment crowd. The problem this country is facing right now is school safety. ',\n",
       " \"We can keep repeating the same talking points and talking over each other again and again and again after something like this happens. Or maybe it's trying to actually find a solution to this problem. The children of this country deserve to be protected. They deserve safe schools. \",\n",
       " 'As the president said, no child, no teacher should ever be in danger in an American school. We could all agree on that. No parent should have to fear for their son or daughters when they kiss them goodbye in the morning. ',\n",
       " 'I want to lay out a solution that I think is not political and, frankly, I believe any reasonable person can agree on. This is about the safety and security of students and children in our schools. And every single school in the country immediately a comprehensive, threat assessment done by law enforcement professionals. ',\n",
       " \"Every school has a unique situation. And for those that will say oh, oh, where are we going to get the money for this? Well, I would argue that it's probably more than likely local police, local FBI would be happy to help schools figure out the best plan of action to protect these kids and keep them safe. \",\n",
       " \"You're going to have to secure the perimeter of every school. All points of entry must be secure. You've got make sure that there is a system that controls who is going in and out of the building. \",\n",
       " 'And in addition to that, you will need a strong, physical security presence. And you can start by hiring trained, armed, former, or retired police officers, trained, armed, former retired armed military veterans. ',\n",
       " \"In other words, let's give our kids the same security that most politicians that they get. Let's give them the same protection that actors and actresses get on the red carpet when they are at the Oscars and pretty much everywhere else they go. We have plenty of retired officers, plenty of trained professionals, plenty of trained military guys. They can conceal their weapons. But their very presence also with the strategy, strategic plan that is properly implemented will bring about a profound change. \",\n",
       " 'I know there are probably detractors out there say but, Sean, Parkland, Florida high school, they had an armed security guard. ',\n",
       " \"OK, here's the thing. The school has 3,000 students. It's one of the biggest campuses in Florida. You're going to need more than one person to properly assess and deter any potential threat at a facility that large. We need enough people to protect every single building, every point of entry, and the entire perimeter. \",\n",
       " \"Some of you will argue, OK, this is going to cost money. You're right. My answer is, yes. But is it not worth every penny so that we never ever have to turn on our TVs like yesterday and see this unfold ever again like what happened in Parkland? \",\n",
       " 'Here is another point about the plan. We already know it works. I broadcast from New York City. And post-9/11, you cannot enter a single office building without a work ID. I have a radio building I enter. I have a TV building I enter. ',\n",
       " 'If you are a visitor in any of these buildings, you have to present a valid identification, or else you are not getting in. And have you to be vouched for by people that have been secured and already in the building or work in the building. Every student can have their own valid ID before entering the school and also where needed metal detectors which have already proven to be effective in some schools in the country. ',\n",
       " \"Here's the bottom line, we are at a crossroads. It's time to either step up, do our job, create school safety that will work for these kids. Give them the same safety our politicians, actors, actresses, and famous people get. And instead of bringing out the same old talking points and trying to score cheap political points and trying to outdo each other with the same arguments, same attacks, nobody's minds being changed, maybe for once we can solve the problem. And this should be all about solutions. \",\n",
       " \"I'm not saying this plan is flawless. Nothing is ever going to stop 100 percent of these things from happening. There is evil in the hearts of other people, unfortunately, in this world. But, why wouldn't we try to do every single thing we can do in this case to prevent these tragedies from occurring and make them less deadly if, in fact, they do happen. \",\n",
       " \"Here's a simple test and a question for everybody tonight I think they can ask themselves. If God forbid you ever found yourself in any type of administrative building and that building has an active shooter, would you prefer to know that there are trained, armed, retired military and police already on site to give you a fighting chance? Would you want to know that there was a complete threat assessment, security assessment on that building that was completed? My guess is you probably. \",\n",
       " \"Here's our final point. Democrats, they say gun control leads to less violence.

We have former LAPD detective Fox News contributor Mark Fuhrman former FBI special agent Manny Gomez. Mark I have known you over the years. We don't often disagree, you have seen a couple of flaws in what I think -- you are never going to convince an antigun person to be pro-second amendment and similarly I have carried a weapon almost all of my adult life. I have had carry permits in New York, California, Alabama, Georgia and Rhode Island. I have had carry permits. It's part of -- I was trained since I'm 11 in the use of a firearm. So, you are not going to win on that debate. But securing the schools with the professionals to me is 1,000 percent doable. And we owe it to the kids to do this. \",\n",
       " \"MARK FUHRMAN, DETECTIVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: We do. We do. And the only thing that -- I don't disagree with you. I just think that there is a better approach. When you have retired personnel, they have the best part of their career behind them, and you need a generational gap that isn't two or three generations perhaps the better part of one. These officers on the school need to be able to interact with these students and get that information that a guy like Cruz would have surfaced and they would have actually confided in the officer. You need to get some kind of a system where have you protocols for all these schools so everybody is working off the same sheet of music. And you need to harden the inside targets so the suspect can't get in, and you create the tactical situation for a shooter on the outside, which allows responding officers and the security officers to take out the suspect with no danger to the students. I think this is all possible without gun control. \",\n",
       " 'HANNITY: All of it is. Strategically and tactically. Look, my guess, Manny, is you are going to have retired military, retired police or maybe active. I think you can even work in conjunction with local law enforcement to get this done and, again, it would be conceal carry. I think a lot of the students would become friends with these guys over time and Mark is right. We can get a lot of intelligence from them. But strategically, tactically, you surround the perimeter. You have a full threat assessment, security assessment. All -- we know the entry point at any point. And all of this, everybody gets in is known. Nobody that is unknown gets in to that school, period, end of sentence. It seems doable if we choose to do it. ',\n",

Having the experience of former military, former law enforcement, we just had a wonderful piece where the coach from this high school saved lives. This is a coach that knew these students. He was a father-figure perhaps. Certainly an adult figure to these young men and women. That is what we need. We need people that these young people will respect, look up to if they have problems. Whether it's an active shooter situation or on a more day-to-day basis. A drug condition, a criminal condition, a bullying condition, they will go up to these former law enforcement, former military role models and be able to discuss with them what they could do to help the situation.

Just remember that all security from the protection of the President to anything that the FBI does, the Israelis, anybody will tell you, security is a layered event. It's not just one.
