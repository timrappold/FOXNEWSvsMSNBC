       "'\\nTHE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELLMarch 16, 2018Guest: Barry McCaffrey, Harry Litman, Ned Price, David Cay Johnston, Ruth Marcus, Benjamin Wittes, Jill Wine-Banks; Michael Avenatti\\nRACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Now, it`s time for THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL. Good evening, Lawrence.\\nLAWRENCE O`DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: Good evening, Rachel. So if you get a standing ovation for pleading guilty, what do you get for pleading not guilty?\\nMADDOW: Yes.\\nO`DONNELL: I mean, that`s – you get a car or something? You must get a prize.\\nMADDOW: If Paul Manafort was able – well, despite the ankle bracelets, if Paul Manafort was able to walk into that room, I imagine they would have like – they would have declared him a saint. I don`t know.\\nO`DONNELL: Rachel, we got this extraordinary news tonight about the President trying to move the Stormy Daniels lawsuit into federal court, which, of course, is the place where he appoints the judges.\\nStormy Daniels` lawyer is actually on an airplane at this moment. We hope to hear from him as soon as he lands, but I want to bring you something else which is what Barry McCaffrey – General Barry McCaffrey said tonight. General Barry McCaffrey is going to be our first guest.\\nNow, I just want to get your reaction to what he said before I go to the General. He tweeted, reluctantly, I have concluded that President Trump is a serious threat to U.S. national security. He is refusing to protect vital U.S. interests from active Russian attacks. It is apparent that he is, for some unknown reason, under the sway of Mr. Putin.\\nMADDOW: Wow. I mean, that`s remarkable because of who is saying it. To have General McCaffrey – I mean, General McCaffrey is a four-star general, right?\\nO`DONNELL: Yes. That`s correct, yes.\\nMADDOW: There aren`t that many four-star generals in American history, let alone in America. And to have him saying something that serious, talking about it being under the sway of Pentagon and being a national security threat, that`s – that is – that`s very grave.\\nI`m glad you`re going to have him on. I would love to hear him explain why he has come to a conclusion that serious.\\nO`DONNELL: And we all remember the White House Press Secretary saying you must never question or doubt the generals. I suspect that this particular general might run into a little something from this White House.\\nMADDOW: Yes, exactly. Well, well done for him.\\nO`DONNELL: Thank you, Rachel.\\nMADDOW: Thanks, Lawrence.\\nO`DONNELL: Thank you. And now joining us by phone is General Barry McCaffrey. He`s a retired four-star general, decorated combat veteran of Vietnam. He`s also an MSNBC military analyst.\\nGeneral McCaffrey, thank you very much for joining us tonight. And I`m wondering, why tonight? What was it that brought you to this point of seeing this president as a serious threat to U.S. national security? I know you didn`t choose those words lightly.\\nGEN. BARRY MCCAFFREY (RET.), MSNBC MILITARY ANALYST (via telephone): No, not at all. You know, I`ve been fairly critical of the President for a variety of reasons. But what really, I think – the turning point in my mind was his reluctance to personally stand with the Brits over what has been a documented series of essentially Russian intelligence murders in London.\\nAnd the latest one being really a signature-attempted assassination of the former Russian intelligence officer and his daughter using a chemical agent that was clearly only available to former Soviet operatives. So I – you know, it was clear that –\\nO`DONNELL: General McCaffrey, I`m going to have to interrupt you with some breaking news now from the Justice Department. Jeff – Attorney General Jeff Sessions has just fired Andrew McCabe, who was, briefly, the acting director of the FBI.\\nMcCabe, who had stepped down from his post earlier this year but remained an FBI employee, had been accused by the Justice Department`s Inspector General of authorizing the disclosure of sensitive information to a reporter and misleading investigators when asked about it.\\nMcCabe had been a lightning rod in the political battles surrounding the investigation into Hillary Clinton`s use of a private e-mail server and Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III`s probe into whether any Trump associates coordinated with Russian agents to interfere in the 2016 presidential race.\\nAnd we are now joined by phone by Pete Williams, NBC News` Justice Department correspondent.\\nPete, what can you tell us about this?\\nPETE WILLIAMS, NBC NEWS JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Well, what the Attorney General says in a statement that just came out a few seconds ago is that he has accepted the recommendation from both the Justice Department`s Inspector General and the FBI`s Office of Personnel Responsibility, the OPR – the Professional Responsibility.\\nBoth had recommended that Andrew McCabe be fired for two reasons according to Jeff Sessions` statement. First, they say he authorized the unauthorized disclosure of information about the Clinton investigation while the investigation was going on. And what the Inspector General had said is that violates FBI policy not to discuss investigations while they`re going on.\\nBut secondly, and perhaps more importantly, what the statement from the Attorney General says is that when McCabe was asked about this on more than one occasion, including while he was under oath, his answers, they believe, were not truthful. And on – for that reason, the Attorney General says he concluded that it was right to accept the recommendation, so Andy McCabe has been fired.\\nNow, what this means for his pension, which, of course, is an important question. He was – he`s actual retirement date, Lawrence, was two days from now, Sunday, his birthday. That`s the day he put – he actually stepped down as Deputy FBI Director in late January presumably at the urging of the FBI Director, Chris Wray, who was aware of these recommendations.\\nBut McCabe had said his retirement date would be this coming Sunday. So this puts his pension in jeopardy, but it doesn`t necessarily mean that he`ll lose it according to government personnel experts that I talked to earlier today. He has some options. He can pursue – that he can pursue that, perhaps, will preserve part of his pension.\\nBut the bottom line here is that the Attorney General has accepted the recommendation and emphasizes in his statement that this is what the Justice Department`s Inspector General and the FBI recommended. Obviously attempting to say that this was not politically motivated, Lawrence.\\nO`DONNELL: Pete, let me just get those distinctions clear. So it`s a recommendation not just from the Inspector General but also a recommendation from the FBI?\\nWILLIAMS (via telephone): Right. So here`s the sequence. As you were saying, the Inspector General, right after the inauguration, launched – said he was launching an investigation into how the FBI handled the entire Clinton e-mail investigation.\\nAs part of that, he became aware that, in October of 2016, the FBI – “The Wall Street Journal” was working on a story about the status of the Clinton investigation and had picked up suggestions that the FBI was dragging its feet on part of that, which is an investigation of the Clinton Foundation.\\nAnd what apparently happened here is that Andrew McCabe authorized someone in the FBI to talk to “The Wall Street Journal” reporter and basically say, no, that`s not the case. You know, we believe there`s still reasons to keep that going.\\nSo that is what got the Inspector General`s attention. And then when – according to the I.G., when he was questioned about it, he wasn`t fully forthcoming, Andrew McCabe. So the I.G. made a recommendation to the FBI`s Office of Professional Responsibility that he be fired.\\nOPR looked into it, concurred, and then, in essence, that would have been the end of it, except that McCabe appealed this to the Justice Department, which is his right. And now, the Attorney General says he`s reviewed it and thinks the recommendations are correct.\\nO`DONNELL: And, Pete, I just want to clarify for the audience, the Inspector General is not a Trump appointee. This Inspector General is a long-time Justice Department employee, isn`t he?\\nWILLIAMS (via telephone): Right. He was – he`s been there – he served under the Obama administration as well, Michael Horowitz.\\nO`DONNELL: And “The Wall Street Journal” article in question actually cites sources at certain points that are labeled as sources close to McCabe, and so it was pretty obvious that – where “The Journal” was getting that help.\\nBut the information that was coming from the McCabe sources actually read as not – as somewhat anti-Clinton information. It was information that pushed the investigation further in the direction of looking at what Hillary Clinton was doing.\\nWILLIAMS (via telephone): Well, that`s right. I mean, two points about that, Lawrence. One is, the article itself says that the FBI officials that talked to “The Journal” reporter, who, by the way, is named Devlin Barrett. He is now at “The Washington Post.” You know, he has covered the Justice Department for many years and is a very smart guy.\\nThe story said that the FBI pushed back at that suggestion, that they were dragging their feet, that they thought there was something to the Clinton Foundation investigation.\\nSo it`s not – you know, McCabe has come under a lot of criticism from the President, from Republicans in Congress who thought he was too favorable to Hillary Clinton in the e-mail investigation, but the statement that was given to “The Wall Street Journal” is definitely not favorable to Clinton.\\nO`DONNELL: Pete, why 10:00 p.m. on a Friday night? What happened between, say, 4:00 this afternoon and 10:00 p.m. tonight? What prevented the Attorney General from doing this during normal business hours?\\nWILLIAMS (via telephone): Well, only yesterday did Andrew McCabe meet with the staff of the Deputy Attorney General. So the Deputy Attorney General had to take his time with this and then pass it along to the Attorney General, who was out of town yesterday. He was meeting with the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Nashville and then had another meeting in Louisville and didn`t get back until late today.\\nSo Jeff Sessions didn`t have a chance to look at this – and we were told earlier today that this process was moving very slowly. I think, you know, to be quite candid here, Jeff Sessions was in, politically, for himself, a no-win situation. This is somebody who had been – Andrew McCabe had been criticized repeatedly by name by the President.\\nSo if – no matter what happened – and also, people were well aware of Jeff Sessions` own desire to please the President. So no matter what he did, if he said McCabe should be fired as he has done, they`ll be people criticizing him for that. If he said McCabe shouldn`t be fired, that would not please the White House. I mean, it took – put him in a tough position, but that`s the job.\\nO`DONNELL: Pete Williams, thank you very much for joining us tonight with this breaking news.\\nWILLIAMS (via telephone): Yes, sir.\\nO`DONNELL: Attorney General Jeff Sessions firing the former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, just two days before Andrew McCabe`s retirement date was to become official.\\nWe`re now joined by Harry Litman, former U.S. attorney and a deputy assistant attorney general under President Clinton. Also Ned Price, former senior director and spokesperson for the National Security Council and a former CIA analyst.\\nRuth Marcus, deputy editorial page editor and columnist at “The Washington Post.” As well as David Cay Johnston, Pulitzer Price-winning journalist and author of “It`s Even Worse than You Think: What the Trump Administration Is Doing to America.”\\nWe have a panel who has seen everything.\\nHarry Litman, I want to go to you first. You`ve worked in the Justice Department. What`s your reading of this?\\nHARRY LITMAN, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: My reading is it`s a grave injustice, Lawrence. There`s – Pete`s reporting is accurate, and there is a serious mark on McCabe`s record. The record overall, though, is of 21 years of exemplary service and respect by everyone within the Department.\\nWhat really stinks about this one is the rush to get this done by Friday, which could – was only motivated to, in a petty way, take his pension away from him.\\nCompare this with John Yoo, the author of the Torture Memos. The same thing happened to him. OPR recommended a certain discipline. It then went to the Attorney General. Yoo was given six months to write a long brief, state his case to the Attorney General, which – who, in fact, did reduce the sentence.\\nThe fact that McCabe was rushed into this presentation yesterday and Sessions turns it around today, I think, is completely abnormal and was done only in order to be sure they could take away his pension before Sunday.\\nO`DONNELL: Harry, let me stay with you on this distinction because the case you just mentioned was not a member of the FBI. Is there, within the Justice Department, a different, a higher standard for members of the FBI in situations like this which, in the reports, indicates did not tell the truth when he was questioned?\\nLITMAN: The short answer is no. McCabe was of a certain level that the Attorney General himself needed to decide the issue, but the overall procedural path from the I.G. – the same I.G. – to OPR to the Attorney General is the same. It just happens that the OPR, in one instance, is with the FBI and the other instance, Department of Justice.\\nNo reason at all to do it on this timeline except to maliciously take away this guy`s pension, something that FBI agents really think about, know about, and are going to be shaken up about.\\nO`DONNELL: Ned Price, your reaction to this?\\nNED PRICE, FORMER ANALYST, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: Well, Lawrence, I would agree with Harry. Something about this smells very fishy. And it`s more than just the timing.\\nIt`s more than the fact that this comes just 48 hours or so before his retirement would kick in. It`s more than the fact that this takes place on a Friday night at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time. It`s also the fact that this takes place separate and apart from the release of the Inspector General Report.\\nThe Inspector General Report on Andrew McCabe in the broader Hillary Clinton matter, as I understand it, has been completed for a while now. It`s been undergoing review.\\nSo why rush this? Why has it aggregated to pull out the Andy McCabe information, fire him well before, it seems, the I.G. Report is going to be released?\\nWe also have to remember the point you raised before. The information Andy McCabe is accused of giving to “The Wall Street Journal” was very damning, was very troubling for the Clinton campaign. It did not look good.\\nThere were previous instances of top Trump officials giving information to news outlets that is exculpatory for the Trump people, that looks good for them. They have never taken fire from that.\\nMike Pompeo, it has been well-documented on at least one occasion – and I highly suspect there have been more – have reached out early on in the administration to news outlets to tamp down these rumors at the time that there may have been rampant connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians. We now know that to be true.\\nMike Pompeo was not disciplined. In fact, Mike Pompeo was just nominated to be the Secretary of State. So I suspect that if what Andy McCabe had done was give information that was exculpatory towards the Trump campaign, we would be seeing a very different outcome here. As it stands, this looks more like anything than a purge.\\nO`DONNELL: Andy McCabe has given just a couple of comments to “The New York Times” tonight, and he is saying that he believes his firing by Jeff Sessions tonight was – is intended to affect the Special Prosecutor`s investigation and particularly Andrew McCabe`s credibility in that conversation – in that investigation.\\nHe said, the idea that I was dishonest is just wrong. This is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness.\\nAnd, of course, he means as a witness in the Mueller investigation.\\nHe went on to say – Andrew McCabe did – it`s incredibly unfair to my reputation after a 21-year career. The real damage is being done to the FBI, law enforcement, and the Special Counsel.\\nDavid Cay Johnston, your reaction to this breaking news?\\nDAVID CAY JOHNSTON, AUTHOR, “IT`S EVEN WORSE THAN YOU THINK: WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS DOING TO AMERICA”: Well, first of all, I agree with both the lawyers that this is extraordinary. There is a long history of people in the FBI doing things they shouldn`t do and getting full official reports that sort of take care of them. But Donald has a long history of going on the attack.\\nIf he is accused of anything, he learned from Roy Cohn you go on the attack. And so he needs to try and discredit and suppress the Mueller investigation. And one of the things that will help him do that is to try and make Andrew McCabe appear to be less credible. That`s exactly what this is about exactly.\\nAnd it sends a secondary signal from this White House, which is you do your job as a law enforcement agent and it`s going to cause me trouble as president, we`ll get you.\\nO`DONNELL: Harry Litman, there`s another striking coincidence in this breaking news tonight. There is a – there`s what would have been the massive breaking news of the night which is the President of the United States actively engaging in trying to move a lawsuit by Stormy Daniels out of a state court in California into a federal court, the court where the President appoints the judges.\\nThat story now is competing with this new breaking news story. The President has not tweeted about his legal move tonight, that he is a part of, to try to move the Stormy Daniels case into federal court, but he has just tweeted about Andrew McCabe.\\nI think we know which one of these stories he wants us to concentrate on. He just tweeted FBI Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits.\\nThis is actually a tweet that he did previously about this because the President was eager to get this done before this retirement date. But it`s so striking that with the Stormy Daniels story breaking – in less than an hour after it broke, that the President was trying to move that into federal court. Within the hour of that news breaking, Jeff Sessions executes this firing.\\nLITMAN: Yes. We`ve gotten pretty used to nasty business coming on Friday afternoon or evening. And here you`re right, we have a double dose of it.\\nI think he is going to want to tout the McCabe point which, again, serves only as a kind of petty gesture to – in favor of opponents of McCabe just stripping him of his pension for no good reason. And he is going to want to dampen the fact that this motion requires him to acknowledge his role in the Stormy Daniels controversy.\\nHe is – he has moved to take this case from state court to federal court. In brief, he has the right to do it. And the whole idea here, 100 percent, is to try to use the arbitration clause in the hush money contract to keep her from talking.\\nAnd his prospects are going to be a little bit better in federal court because federal judges, he not only appoints them but they`re well known to be more well-disposed to the sort of arbitration clause that he wants to use as a sword here.\\nO`DONNELL: Ruth Marcus is joining us, “The Washington Post” columnist.\\nRuth, the Stormy Daniels lawsuit, we just got the filing on it just before we were going on the air tonight. And then minutes later, we get this firing by Jeff Sessions.\\nThe Stormy Daniels lawsuit that the President is now actively engaged in threatens Stormy Daniels with $20 million in damages. That`s specified by the President and the President`s Lawyer in the filing that they issued tonight. And then Jeff Sessions comes along right after that with this firing.\\nRUTH MARCUS, DEPUTY EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: So if I were Stormy Daniels` lawyer, I would tell her to sit tight and don`t worry what number the President and his lawyers are coming up with to threaten her with.\\nIf she wants to talk, they`re not going to be able to stop her from talking. We do not have prior restraint in this country for porn actresses talking about their relationships with a President. If he wants to sue her and she can then go and depose him and have a lawsuit and have discovery, let them go ahead and do that.\\nI actually really don`t understand the President`s legal strategy, which seems to be bringing maximum attention to Stormy Daniels rather – which he insists she has no credible story to tell. He has just guaranteed that everybody is going to be tuning in to a certain other network to see her talk.\\nSo on that, I want to descend slightly, just a little bit, on Andrew McCabe`s story just for this reason. It`s totally clear and it`s really upsetting and very disturbing that the President has been gunning for Andrew McCabe since the campaign. He`s been gunning to get his pension taken away from him.\\nThis kind of Friday night massacre is a little concerning. On the other hand, I do know the Inspector General at the Justice Department. If it is true that he concluded that Andrew McCabe`s conduct was serious enough to warrant firing, you can`t fire the guy, well, after he retires.\\nI just want to know a little bit more about the underlying conduct before I go sort of whole hog with the rest of the crew in completely decrying this. I am concerned by it. I don`t like to see somebody who`s worked for the government his entire life stripped of his pension.\\nAnd there`s this magnificent Shakespearean quality to all of this, right? Because if Andrew McCabe is fired and – as he was fired and if he loses his pension as a result, it will be because he leaked something that was harmful to Hillary Clinton. The guy who the President kept describing as a pro-Clinton schill. So there`s just a certain magnificence to it.\\nO`DONNELL: Harry Litman –\\nMARCUS: Ironic magnificence.\\nO`DONNELL: Thank you, Ruth. I want to go to Harry Litman on this, as a former Justice Department employee. The Inspector General who made this recommendation is a career employee. He is not a Trump appointee.\\nHe served in the Obama administration, served in – under the Bush administration before that. He has served both Democrat and Republican administrations. So this is not someone who was – had any apparent bias on the Trump side.\\nLITMAN: Look, I agree. Michael Horwitz is his name. He is – he has a well-earned reputation for professionalism and thoroughness, and he put his finger on. McCabe disputes whether – McCabe was candid but Horwitz judged otherwise.\\nMy push back against Ruth, I take her point, just has to do with the timing of this, notwithstanding when his retirement would have been. It`s just 100 percent clear this was driven by political pressure from the White House for the petty reason of stripping him of his pension. That`s wrong. That`s not the way it`s supposed to work.\\nO`DONNELL: I just want to repeat what Andrew McCabe said to “The New York Times” tonight. He said, the idea that I was dishonest is just wrong. He said, this is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness.\\nAnd, David Cay Johnston, he means as a witness in the Special Prosecutor`s investigation. He is a witness to, among other things we know he`s a witness to, the Comey firing.\\nIn that, we know that James Comey spoke to him about what the President said to him. And so when James Comey is presented as a witness describing what the President said and did to him, Andrew McCabe is part of that.\\nJOHNSTON: Yes, and Comey did exactly what you should do in that situation. He immediately went and wrote a note, memorializing the conversation. And courts tend to get give a lot of credence to immediately memorialized observations.\\nAnd then he brought in his top people, including McCabe, to discuss this and the significance of it, partly to make a record with them, but also partly to make sure that he had correctly interpreted and thought about his options in dealing with this.\\nSo it`s important to Trump, in his effort to discredit Mueller, to try and knock off witnesses wherever he can and take away their legitimacy.\\nO`DONNELL: Joining us now –\\nLITMAN: By the way, Lawrence, if I can just quickly say, the Horowitz that is not finished, the bigger topic of it is what Comey did with respect to the Clinton investigation when he came out and said it was extremely careless of her. It may well be that Horowitz will yet also impugn Comey in his broader report.\\nO`DONNELL: Joining the discussion now by phone is Ben Wittes. He`s the editor-in-chief of “Lawfare.” He also knows some of the players involved in this controversy, including James Comey.\\nBen Wittes, your reaction to Attorney General Jeff Sessions tonight firing former Acting Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe two days before his official retirement date?\\nBENJAMIN WITTES, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, LAWFARE (via telephone): I`m very saddened by it. And I wish very much that the resolution of this had been otherwise for the sake of everybody involved, particularly for Andy McCabe who, you know, I still don`t understand and have not seen a factual record that would justify this.\\nI understand that there is an Inspector General report that has, you know, suggested that he engaged in, you know, conduct that justifies this action. But the nature of precisely what he was supposed to have done and what the evidence of that remains entirely opaque to the public.\\nAnd, you know, as far as I can tell, Andy McCabe is somebody who served with a lot of honor and dignity under exceptionally difficult circumstances. And so until I see – excuse me. Until I see a record that would justify this action taken two days before he was due to retire by – you know, in the face of presidential tweets demanding his scalp, I will, you know, regard it as an action that may be very difficult to justify.\\nAnd that said, I will reserve judgment until I see what the Inspector General has said and what I see when – what I – whatever I see Andy has responded to that and so that I understand what the parameters of the dispute really are.\\nO`DONNELL: The only response we have from Andrew McCabe at this point is a comment he made to “The New York Times” tonight. And he said, the idea that I was dishonest is just wrong. This is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness.\\nAnd, Ben Wittes, he – obviously, he means as a witness in the Mueller investigation. What is your reaction to that?\\nWITTES (via telephone): Well, I mean, he is a witness in that investigation at least on the question of corroborating Jim Comey`s claims about his interactions with Donald Trump.\\nAnd so to the extent that the FBI has concluded – or the Inspector General has concluded that he was not honest with their investigation, that would have a discrediting effect in the context of a different investigation. Whether it`s justifiable or not, of course, depends on the evidence that the public doesn`t have access to right now.\\nO`DONNELL: Andrew McCabe has apparently just released a statement tonight. It`s a rather lengthy one. I will try to read some of it – actually, I`m going to start reading it.\\nNed Price, as you start – give us your reaction again to this, to the possibility that this is actually, the timing of this, is related to the Mueller investigation because Andrew McCabe is obviously a witness in that investigation. As Ben Wittes just said, a corroborating witness to James Comey. And if you can get him fired from his job for being untruthful, that would have an effect on his credibility as a witness.\\nPRICE: Well, I think that`s exactly right, Lawrence. We know from what Director Comey has said, what he has written, that he shared his encounters, those encounters where President Trump may well have at least attempted to obstruct justice. That he shared those encounters with a very small group of people, all of whom have now been either sidelined or fired.\\nAnd in the case of Andy McCabe, he, of course, was sidelined weeks ago. And now his firing, I suspect, as Andy McCabe himself is saying, was to undermine his credibility as a fact witness, as Ben was alluding to.\\nThe other point I think we have to remember here, though, Lawrence, is that we haven`t heard from Michael Horowitz, the Inspector General. We have heard from Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, someone who, of course, is not unbiased.\\nAnd we don`t have to go that far back in history. In fact, only to this week, to recall what happened to Rex Tillerson and the account – the differing accounts that we heard from the White House and what we heard from the State Department.\\nThe White House put out a statement leading all of us to believe that Rex Tillerson knew this was coming, that he knew that his time was up, but the State Department, it seems in a bit of candor that actually led to an individual`s firing, said that this took him completely by surprise.\\nSo I`m not sure we can give this full credence and credibility, knowing that Jeff Sessions has squandered a lot of his credibility. And I, frankly, want to hear from Michael Horowitz.\\nJOHNSTON: Lawrence, there`s also an issue here of proportionality. We`re not talking about Andrew McCabe having paid somebody off not to tell a story. We`re not talking about him having screwed up cases of the FBI`s.\\nWe`re talking about how he handled an effort to deal with a journalist who had a story they thought was wrong. So the punishment here is totally out of proportion to the action, even if he was not fully candid.\\nO`DONNELL: Let`s hear from Andrew McCabe. This is his written statement that has just been released. I will read portions of it.\\nHe says, for the last year and a half, my family and I have been the targets of an unrelenting assault on our reputation and my service to this country. Articles too numerous to count have leveled every sort of false, defamatory, and degrading allegations against us.\\nThe President`s tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all. He called for my firing. He called for me to be stripped of my pension after more than 20 years of service.\\nAnd all along, we have said nothing, never wanting to distract from the mission of the FBI by addressing the lies told and repeated about us.\\nNo more. The investigation by the Justice Department`s Office of Inspector General has to be understood in the context of the attacks on my credibility. The investigation flows from my attempt to explain the FBI`s involvement and my supervision of investigations involving Hillary Clinton.\\nI was being portrayed in the media, over and over, as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes.\\nNothing was further from the truth. In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau and to make clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.\\nThe OIG investigation has focused on information I chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I was one of the – one of only a few people who had the authority to do that.\\nIt was not a secret. It took place over several days and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter.\\nIt was the type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week. In fact, it was the same type of work that I continue to do under Director Wray at his request.\\nThe investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth. During those inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.\\nBut looking at that in isolation completely misses the big picture. The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized, public servants are attacked, and people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people.\\nAnd, Harry Litman, I want to get your reaction to that much of Andrew McCabe`s statement.\\nLITMAN: It`s true. It`s tragic. The broader story here – first on McCabe, the broader story, as Ben and Ned say, is one of exemplary public service, respected across the – from everybody, and an unfair tarring.\\nBut this broader theme that he sounds at the end of his statement, politicization of law enforcement, is just nauseating. And it`s continued and continued.\\nWhat they`re trying to do to him now – Trump had his Press Secretary go out and call McCabe, to America, a bad actor today. It`s reminiscent of the defamation that they visited on Comey when he was fired, and they said, falsely, the whole FBI had turned against him.\\nThis kind of assault on independent law enforcement by the White House for the small ends of trying to affect the investigation against the President is really dangerous and toxic.\\nO`DONNELL: I want to read one more passage of Andrew McCabe`s written statement tonight. He says, here is the reality. I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey.\\nThe release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey`s accounts of his discussions with the President.\\nThe OIG`s focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn.\\nThe accelerated release of the report and the punitive actions taken in response make sense only when viewed through this lens. Thursday`s comments from the White House are just the latest example of this.\\nThis attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally.\\nIt is part of this administration`s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel`s work.\\nBen Wittes, your reaction to Andrew McCabe saying that the reality here is that he is being singled out.\\nHe said, I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey.\\nWITTES (via telephone): Look, we don`t know what the underlying evidence that the I.G. has reported about Andrew McCabe is. We do know that the singling out of the Deputy FBI Director by the President of the United States on a repeated basis is a unique event in the history of the United States.\\nWe do know that firing a long-serving FBI official two days before he is due to retire anyway is a highly unusual matter. And we do know that the political pressure on the Justice Department to do that was extreme.\\nSo I can`t say that, you know, Andy McCabe`s protestations of innocence of whatever it is the Inspector General has found about him are accurate. I can say that the situation stinks.\\nAnd as I said before, I will evaluate the evidence that supposedly justifies this action at the point in which it becomes public. And until then, look, a lot of what Andy McCabe is saying in that statement is just plainly true.\\nO`DONNELL: And, Ruth Marcus, as Ben just said, we don`t have the Inspector General`s report, but we have Andrew McCabe`s written response to it at this first stage of this news. And I`m going to zero in on the sentences in which Andrew McCabe is directly dealing with what must be in that Inspector General`s report.\\nHe says, during these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.\\nAnd, Ruth, when we get to read the Inspector General`s Report, I believe there will be several pages that describe what Andrew McCabe is describing there, and we`ll have to hold one against the other.\\nMARCUS: Right. And two things can simultaneously be true, and Ben put this well when he was describing it.\\nIt is absolutely clear – name another Deputy Director of the FBI who was -- became a household name. He became a household name because he was attacked by, first, presidential candidate Donald Trump and then President Donald Trump.\\nAnd he is – and he was attacked and I would submit, probably fired, for largely political reasons. And I would throw in there the absolutely shameful singling out that Sarah Huckabee Sanders did of him from the podium yesterday.\\nBut this episode that he alludes to, you know, it`s part of this behind the scenes dance that`s a really necessary part of Washington that goes on, where, on background, officials guide reporters to help reporters get their stories more accurate, to make sure that things are not written that are unfair to subjects or targets of an investigation.\\nThis is a dance that has to go on, that needs to go on behind the scenes. But something happened there that I – that, at least, it sounds like the Inspector General found wasn`t exactly right. And something then seemed to have happened with McCabe`s testimony that the Inspector General, I suspect, had a problem with.\\nSo the fury that McCabe has about the politicization of the FBI and about his being fired, I totally get. I don`t want to say that it`s clear that his conduct has been completely above reproach because it feels like it`s a much more complicated story than that.\\nO`DONNELL: And, David Cay Johnston, it seems like Andrew McCabe has a lot more that we`re probably eventually going to hear about this. And I think we`re so lucky that we have experts from the – with Justice Department experience here as well as reporters because this is a report – this is a journalism story, too.\\nAnd McCabe is in trouble because of communication with “The Wall Street Journal,” with reporters. McCabe describes that in his written statement tonight as his job.\\nJOHNSTON: Right. Yes.\\nO`DONNELL: He says, this is one of the things that the Deputy FBI Director is charged with doing, clarifying for the press, when possible, what the FBI is doing or what it`s not doing.\\nAnd so he says here that he has done this – he said, it was the type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times a week. In fact, it was the same type of work that I continued to do under Director Wray at his request.\\nSo he is saying the Trump-appointed FBI Director had him doing exactly the same thing with the press.\\nJOHNSTON: Yes, you get to see the knife with that one.\\nO`DONNELL: Yes.\\nJOHNSTON: Well, this is exactly how this stuff works. And, of course, the FBI and other agencies are concerned. They don`t want a reporter who has a story to mess up their investigation. Witnesses can be affected by these things.\\nAnd, no, we don`t know exactly what McCabe did, but I think there`s a very pregnant line there about how when he evidently felt that the people who questioned him didn`t get his answers the way he intended, he set out to correct them.\\nNow, unless there`s something showing that he was mendacious and obviously so, it would seem to suggest that he may have been, to some degree, set up, or – and he certainly clearly indicates he believes he was trying to make the record as accurate as possible.\\nO`DONNELL: And describes in his first round of trying to remember truthful answers about this, he says he was doing the best he could “amidst the chaos that surrounded me.” And I think we all have a feel for what that must have been.\\nWe`re joined now by phone by Jill Wine-Banks. She`s a former assistant Watergate special prosecutor, and she`s an MSNBC contributor.\\nAnd, Jill, I wish you could be on camera because we could see your St. Patrick`s Green, again, which I saw earlier tonight, that you are wearing.\\nBut, Jill, I want to get your reaction to this story. At first, we began simply with the fact that Jeff Sessions, at 10:00 p.m. tonight approximately, on a Friday night, fired Andrew McCabe, the former Acting Director of the FBI with only two days left before his official retirement.\\nWe now have a full written statement by Andrew McCabe that I`ve been reading here. Your reaction to what we know about this so far.\\nJILL WINE-BANKS, FORMER ASSISTANT WATERGATE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR (via telephone): Well, first of all, let me say we take St. Patrick`s Day very seriously in Chicago, so that`s why.\\nO`DONNELL: I know you do.\\n(LAUGHTER)\\nWINE-BANKS (via telephone): Yes.\\nO`DONNELL: I know you do.\\nWINE-BANKS (via telephone): But on a serious note, I mean, at 10:00 p.m. on a Friday night before his Sunday retirement becomes effective does throw some doubt into the credibility and reasons for the action.\\nI do agree, of course, with Ben that we need to have all the evidence before we pass judgment on what the recommendation was. We need to see the I.G. Report.\\nI also think that his statement, the McCabe statement, is a very persuasive and compelling one that I`d like to know more about the background of.\\nAnd I wonder whether the President realizes that all of these people that he fires now have no reason not to cooperate fully with Mueller and to speak out, and whether people are realizing how much distraction is happening in the chaos at the White House from the Mueller investigation, from the Stormy Daniels investigation, and from the overall effect of trying to taint the FBI and Mueller and the Department of Justice, and whether McCabe has been denied due process.\\nI cannot believe that he`s already had a hearing that would be entitled to any senior service person, such as himself, before he gets fired. He hasn`t had a chance to defend himself and tell his side of the story, so I don`t think we should jump to conclusions that he`s innocent or that he`s guilty. We need to see the full evidence.\\nAnd in the context of this president and how they have attacked not just McCabe but the entire FBI and the Department of Justice and Mueller, it makes me suspicious, it makes me suspicious and makes me wonder about the truth of it.\\nO`DONNELL: Harry Litman, I want to go to one of the points that Andrew McCabe raises, which he believes that this is a design to damage his credibility as a witness in the Mueller investigation. What`s your reaction to that?\\nLITMAN: Well, it`s true and that`s probably what – I mean, Trump has that in mind as a practical goal. It seems to me he just has the more petty mind – goal in mind of just gratuitously taking away the pension of someone who has crossed him. To me –\\nO`DONNELL: But, Harry, can I –\\nLITMAN: Yes.\\nO`DONNELL: Can I ask you to focus, as a legal practitioner –\\nLITMAN: Sure.\\nO`DONNELL: – on the actual practical effect of this –\\nLITMAN: Yes.\\nO`DONNELL: – on the perceived credibility of Andrew McCabe as a witness going forward? If you were in the Special Prosecutor`s office and you had the McCabe file, you were in charge of him as a witness going forward, how would you feel tonight?\\nLITMAN: Look, you know, I would feel only a little worse. There are all kinds of people they – that they use that will some impeachment material.\\nBut, yes, here is how it all will be. He will testify if it comes to a proceeding that Comey told him exactly what Comey said he said.\\nAnd then the defense attorney will say, oh, is that right? Well, are you aware – isn`t it true, Mr. McCabe, that you were found to have committed misconduct? Isn`t it true that you were fired, et cetera, et cetera?\\nAnd that impeachment will have whatever value it has in front of a jury. I just want to say here, though, that it`s true, as Ben and Ruth says, that part of what`s going on – we, of course, don`t know exactly what he did and it`s very odd that Horowitz found these things.\\nBut I just I think it`s all secondary next to two points. Whatever he did, the timing of his being railroaded out is indefensible and political. And most important of all, the political themes of demonization of law enforcement that he sounds at the end of his statement, that those really should be, I think, the headline for us as a country.\\nO`DONNELL: I have already brought up the timing coincidence that, as we went into this hour of television, I believed that our hotter breaking news tonight was going to be about the President`s attempt to move Stormy Daniels` lawsuit into federal court.\\nI want to switch focus to that because it`s hard to believe that the timing is coincidental tonight, that the President did – was not paying attention to what was happening in this news cycle and how this announcement could change that.\\nThe President of the United States is actually asking a federal court in California to take jurisdiction of Stormy Daniels` lawsuit against Donald Trump. The President of the United States is asking the federal court to take the lawsuit away from a California state court.\\nAnd tonight`s legal filing in federal court in California by a California lawyer representing the President of the United States claims that Stormy Daniels` lawsuit against Donald Trump should be moved from state court to federal court because Stormy Daniels is a resident of Texas, Donald Trump is a resident of Washington, D.C. and New York City.\\nAnd because of the multistate locations of the parties, the case should not be heard in a California state court since none of the parties live in California.\\nThe legal filing says that President Trump and his lawyers are, quote, aware of at least 20 violations by Clifford – that`s Stormy Daniels` real name – of the confidentiality provisions of this settlement agreement.\\nClifford expressly agreed in these settlement agreements to liquidated damages in the amount of $1 million for each breach of the confidentiality provisions which is approximated to already be in excess of $20 million.\\nWe are joined by phone now by Stormy Daniels` attorney, Michael Avenatti.\\nAnd, Mr. Avenatti, I know you learned about this when you were on a plane tonight. What is your reaction to the President trying to move this case into federal court?\\nMICHAEL AVENATTI, ATTORNEY FOR STORMY DANIELS (via telephone): Well, thanks for having me. I`m not at all surprised. We anticipated that the President and Mr. Cohen might attempt to do this.\\nIt`s really a prelude. It`s an interim step, if you will, to where they really want to go, which is arbitration. They want this matter decided by a private arbitrator in a conference room in a private office building as opposed to a public courthouse that`s open to the people, where people can actually judge for themselves the facts and the evidence.\\nThis is just more of the same. I mean, it is consistent with the way they have treated my client for some time now. They have attempted to bully her and intimidate her. And ultimately, they do not want this matter public. It`s just that simple.\\nThis is more of the same, their attempts to gag and muzzle my client, and we`re not going to stand for it.\\nO`DONNELL: It`s a really striking legal filing to see because there you see the name of the President of the United States on the title page of this pleading in federal court. And the name of the President of the United States, typed in there by his lawyer, also has an alias beside it typed in there by his lawyer.\\nThe President of the United States has a lawyer who refers to him as Donald J. Trump also known as David Dennison. That is how the President`s lawyer represents Donald Trump in this case, a client with an alias trying to keep everything that Stormy Daniels knows about him secret.\\nAVENATTI (via telephone): Well, I think what is truly remarkable about this – if we just take a step back and really think about this for a moment, I actually think this is a remarkable moment in our nation`s history.\\nI don`t think that there has ever been an instance – and I know that`s a big statement but I stand behind it. I don`t think there`s ever been an incident in the history of the United States where you have a sitting president who undertook a personal vendetta against a private U.S. citizen –\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK.\\nAVENATTI (via telephone): – who merely was –\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK.\\nAVENATTI (via telephone): – who merely was looking for an opportunity to tell her version of events and is seeking $20 million worth of damages. I don`t think that`s ever happened before in the history of the United States. It`s frightening, quite honestly.\\nO`DONNELL: Now, your client has already spoken to “60 Minutes.” “60 Minutes” has announced that they intend to broadcast that interview on, I believe, March 25th. That presumably by the President`s definition will constitute what he considers another breach or another several breaches of this agreement.\\nSo according to the President`s reading of the situation, do you expect at the end of the broadcast of the “60 Minutes” interview for Stormy Daniels, in the President`s view, to be liable for another $20 million or $100 million?\\nAVENATTI (via telephone): No, we don`t. I mean, the President also thinks he won the popular vote, so, you know, I don`t know what to say.\\nBut, look, this $20 million demand or $20 million claim in damages is laughable. And, you know, next I guess, we`ll hear $50 or $100 or $200 million. It`s an absolute joke. We don`t believe the agreement is going to be upheld.\\nAnd even if the agreement is upheld, that liquated damages clause, it will never be upheld because it is what is called legally conscionable, which means, even if the parties agreed to it, and even if they read it and understood it (INAUDIBLE) – confident that no court will enforce a million dollars liquidated (INAUDIBLE) especially when the consideration monetarily was only $130,000.\\nSo this pie in the sky. It`s a bullying tactic. It`s designed to intimidate my client and I. And clearly, they haven`t been paying attention over the last who weeks.\\nWe`re not going to pack up and go home. We`re not going to dismiss the case. She`s not going to prevent the “60 Minutes” piece from hiring.\\nWe`re going to let the chips fall where they may. We`re going to continue to strive to tell the American people what happened here. And we`re going to allow them to make a determination on who is shooting straight with them and who is not. And it`s that simple.\\nO`DONNELL: And, Mr. Avenatti, I just want to go over one more point before you go. And you know you got a lot of attention this morning on this network on “MORNING JOE” when, in an answer to questions, you`ve said that Stormy Daniels has been threatened and that she has been physically threatened.\\nHas she been threatened by anyone representing or connected to the President?\\nAVENATTI (via telephone): Again, I`m not at liberty to discuss that. I`m confident that when people tune in to “60 Minutes” on the 25th of March, they`re going to learn the details surrounding that threat or the threats. And they are going to judge for themselves as to whether she is telling the truth and whether she`s credible.\\nAnd at some point, Mr. Cohen and the President are going to have to account for their various actions associated with attempting to silence my client. And I am counting the days.\\nO`DONNELL: Did Michael Cohen threaten Stormy Daniels?\\nAVENATTI (via telephone): I`m going to stand by my same answer.\\nO`DONNELL: And when were those threats? When were the most recent threats?\\nAVENATTI (via telephone): I`m not at liberty to discuss the details of the threats. Again, I think when people tune in to the interview, they`re going to learn about it.\\nO`DONNELL: Michael Avenatti, really appreciate you calling in. I know this was difficult for you to do. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much. Really appreciate it.\\nAVENATTI (via telephone): No problem. Have a good weekend. Thank you.\\nO`DONNELL: Thank you. And our legal panel is still here, everyone who has been covering and following both of these.\\nI want to go to Ruth Marcus first because this – before we even get to the legalisms of it, I just want us to pause over the fact that we live in a country where the President of the United States has a lawyer type his name in a legal pleading and then type his alias in right beside it and file that legal pleading in a federal court, in a courthouse, where the President appoints the judges.\\nMARCUS: Well, yes. And you know –\\n(LAUGHTER)\\nMARCUS: It has been quite a day of Stormy Daniels news, as you pointed out, trying to get a little bit more information on what this threat and physical threat was and who it came from. And I am just thinking about where we are and where we`ve been.\\nAnd my reporting career spans the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings where we thought we heard things that we could never get into our newspapers back in those days when certain words weren`t allowed. And we managed to report all of that in our newspapers.\\nAnd then we went to impeachment and Bill Clinton and blue dresses and all sorts of other things that didn`t seem fit for a family audience. And we got those into our newspapers.\\nAnd now here we are with a president and a porn star. And it`s a kind of dreary trajectory of the kind of – of modern politics and the craziness of this moment. And just the sordid nature of what we`re all being dragged into writing about when there are actually serious problems facing the country.\\nThere are serious policy issues to be decided, and we`re talking about porn stars and threats and presidential aliases. So I`m just throwing up my hands here.\\n(LAUGHTER)\\nO`DONNELL: Understandable. David Cay Johnston, no one on this panel knows more about Donald Trump as a litigant than you do. You`ve watched him both be a phony bluffer –\\nMARCUS: I`m not hearing anything.\\nO`DONNELL: – as he was when he threatened to sue me.\\nJOHNSTON: Right.\\nO`DONNELL: And I begged him to sue me because I knew he was bluffing. You`ve seen him actually sue people. You`ve seen him cave. You`ve seen him settle $25 million on Trump University.\\nWhat do you make of this filing tonight? And is this the first one you`ve seen where he includes an alias beside his name?\\nJOHNSTON: Yes, it`s absolutely the first I`ve seen with an alias. And this is extraordinary. Now, of course, in making this filing, they basically acknowledge that this relationship went on, and there was a hush money payment.\\nBut this, again, is Donald`s bullying and going on the attack. And I`ve done as you have. You know, I was – I`ve talked about Donald and the drug trafficker and said, Donald, you know, if you think what I`ve said isn`t true, sue me over it.\\nOne of the interesting things about this case is the removal to federal court. The 1925 Arbitration Act was passed to allow corporations in different states to settle dispute. It was never intended to apply to disputes between individuals, between individuals and companies.\\nIf it were put up today in Congress, it would never pass if it was going to apply to you and me if we were in a dispute.\\nAnd the lawyers on the panel are quite right that the federal courts have a different inclination about this than the state courts. But this is not a dispute that should be allowed under the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act because we`re not talking about two corporations. We have one and – created solely for the purpose of helping, they thought, hide the money.\\nO`DONNELL: Let me go to one of my lawyers. Jill Wine-Banks, your reaction to what Stormy Daniels` lawyer, Michael Avenatti, just have to say?\\nWINE-BANKS (via telephone): Well, first of all, I would say he is doing a wonderful job of representing her and making her look better than the President.\\nAnd David is quite correct that we now have absolute proof that D.D. is President Trump, which is, I think, an unforced error on the part of his lawyers who didn`t think two steps ahead when they filed this suit.\\nI think Michael was quite correct, Avenatti, in saying something about the inequitability of this. For $130,000 payment, she agreed to pay $1 million per every breach? That is not only unconscionable just under the norm frames of contract law. You can`t enforce a contract that is so inequitable. We have a principle, just in general, that that isn`t enforceable.\\nAnd as to your earlier question about whether the credibility of McCabe is so severely hurt, it`s certainly no worse than Flynn and the others who have plead guilty to lying and who will now be the witnesses against the President. And all of them are now free to tell the truth about the President.\\nSo, again, it`s bad thinking on the part of the President`s lawyers to have gotten into the situation where they`re allowing this to happen. I really am just astounded at the bad lawyering on his part and – but they have been effective in distracting us, as Ruth said, from policy, from his bragging about lying to the Prime Minister of Canada, something for which we should be all be apologizing to our neighbors to the north.\\nThere`s so much other things of importance and the people of America can hardly keep track from day to day of what`s important and so nothing sticks.\\nO`DONNELL: Jill Wine-Banks gets tonight`s last word, weaving it all together. Thank you – Ned Price, Harry Litman, Ruth Marcus, David Cay Johnston, Jill Wine-Banks, Benjamin Wittes – thank you all joining us and thanks to Barry McCaffrey for joining us at the beginning of the hour.

       "'chael avenatti  now its time for the last word with     good evening    good evening rachel so if you get a standing ovation for pleading guilty what do you get for pleading not guilty  yes  i mean thats   you get a car or something you must get a prize  if paul manafort was able   well despite the ankle bracelets if paul manafort was able to walk into that room i imagine they would have like   they would have declared him a saint i dont know  rachel we got this extraordinary news tonight about the president trying to move the stormy daniels lawsuit into federal court which of course is the place where he appoints the judges stormy daniels lawyer is actually on an airplane at this moment we hope to hear from him as soon as he lands but i want to bring you something else which is what barry mccaffrey   general barry mccaffrey said tonight general barry mccaffrey is going to be our first guest now i just want to get your reaction to what he said before i go to the general he tweeted reluctantly i have concluded that president trump is a serious threat to us national security he is refusing to protect vital us interests from active russian attacks it is apparent that he is for some unknown reason under the sway of mr putin  wow i mean thats remarkable because of who is saying it to have general mccaffrey   i mean general mccaffrey is a fourstar general right  yes thats correct yes  there arent that many fourstar generals in american history let alone in america and to have him saying something that serious talking about it being under the sway of pentagon and being a national security threat thats   that is   thats very grave im glad youre going to have him on i would love to hear him explain why he has come to a conclusion that serious  and we all remember the white house press secretary saying you must never question or doubt the generals i suspect that this particular general might run into a little something from this white house  yes exactly well well done for him  thank you rachel  thanks    thank you and now joining us by phone is general barry mccaffrey hes a retired fourstar general decorated combat veteran of vietnam hes also an msnbc military analyst general mccaffrey thank you very much for joining us tonight and im wondering why tonight what was it that brought you to this point of seeing this president as a serious threat to us national security i know you didnt choose those words lightly gen barry mccaffrey ret msnbc military analyst via telephone  no not at all you know ive been fairly critical of the president for a variety of reasons but what really i think   the turning point in my mind was his reluctance to personally stand with the brits over what has been a documented series of essentially russian intelligence murders in london and the latest one being really a signatureattempted assassination of the former russian intelligence officer and his daughter using a chemical agent that was clearly only available to former soviet operatives so i   you know it was clear that  general mccaffrey im going to have to interrupt you with some breaking news now from the justice department jeff   attorney general jeff sessions has just fired andrew mccabe who was briefly the acting director of the fbi mccabe who had stepped down from his post earlier this year but remained an fbi employee had been accused by the justice departments inspector general of authorizing the disclosure of sensitive information to a reporter and misleading investigators when asked about it mccabe had been a lightning rod in the political battles surrounding the investigation into hillary clintons use of a private email server and special counsel robert s mueller iiis probe into whether any trump associates coordinated with russian agents to interfere in the 2016 presidential race and we are now joined by phone by pete williams nbc news justice department correspondent pete what can you tell us about this pete williams nbc news justice correspondent via telephone  well what the attorney general says in a statement that just came out a few seconds ago is that he has accepted the recommendation from both the justice departments inspector general and the fbis office of personnel responsibility the opr   the professional responsibility both had recommended that andrew mccabe be fired for two reasons according to jeff sessions statement first they say he authorized the unauthorized disclosure of information about the clinton investigation while the investigation was going on and what the inspector general had said is that violates fbi policy not to discuss investigations while theyre going on but secondly and perhaps more importantly what the statement from the attorney general says is that when mccabe was asked about this on more than one occasion including while he was under oath his answers they believe were not truthful and on   for that reason the attorney general says he concluded that it was right to accept the recommendation so andy mccabe has been fired now what this means for his pension which of course is an important question he was   hes actual retirement date   was two days from now sunday his birthday thats the day he put   he actually stepped down as deputy fbi director in late january presumably at the urging of the fbi director chris wray who was aware of these recommendations but mccabe had said his retirement date would be this coming sunday so this puts his pension in jeopardy but it doesnt necessarily mean that hell lose it according to government personnel experts that i talked to earlier today he has some options he can pursue   that he can pursue that perhaps will preserve part of his pension but the bottom line here is that the attorney general has accepted the recommendation and emphasizes in his statement that this is what the justice departments inspector general and the fbi recommended obviously attempting to say that this was not politically motivated    pete let me just get those distinctions clear so its a recommendation not just from the inspector general but also a recommendation from the fbi williams via telephone  right so heres the sequence as you were saying the inspector general right after the inauguration launched   said he was launching an investigation into how the fbi handled the entire clinton email investigation as part of that he became aware that in october of 2016 the fbi    the wall street journal  was working on a story about the status of the clinton investigation and had picked up suggestions that the fbi was dragging its feet on part of that which is an investigation of the clinton foundation and what apparently happened here is that andrew mccabe authorized someone in the fbi to talk to  the wall street journal  reporter and basically say no thats not the case you know we believe theres still reasons to keep that going so that is what got the inspector generals attention and then when   according to the ig when he was questioned about it he wasnt fully forthcoming andrew mccabe so the ig made a recommendation to the fbis office of professional responsibility that he be fired opr looked into it concurred and then in essence that would have been the end of it except that mccabe appealed this to the justice department which is his right and now the attorney general says hes reviewed it and thinks the recommendations are correct  and pete i just want to clarify for the audience the inspector general is not a trump appointee this inspector general is a longtime justice department employee isnt he williams via telephone  right he was   hes been there   he served under the obama administration as well michael horowitz  and  the wall street journal  article in question actually cites sources at certain points that are labeled as sources close to mccabe and so it was pretty obvious that   where  the journal  was getting that help but the information that was coming from the mccabe sources actually read as not   as somewhat anticlinton information it was information that pushed the investigation further in the direction of looking at what hillary clinton was doing williams via telephone  well thats right i mean two points about that   one is the article itself says that the fbi officials that talked to  the journal  reporter who by the way is named devlin barrett he is now at  the washington post  you know he has covered the justice department for many years and is a very smart guy the story said that the fbi pushed back at that suggestion that they were dragging their feet that they thought there was something to the clinton foundation investigation so its not   you know mccabe has come under a lot of criticism from the president from republicans in congress who thought he was too favorable to hillary clinton in the email investigation but the statement that was given to  the wall street journal  is definitely not favorable to clinton  pete why 10 00 pm on a friday night what happened between say 4 00 this afternoon and 10 00 pm tonight what prevented the attorney general from doing this during normal business hours williams via telephone  well only yesterday did andrew mccabe meet with the staff of the deputy attorney general so the deputy attorney general had to take his time with this and then pass it along to the attorney general who was out of town yesterday he was meeting with the international association of chiefs of police in nashville and then had another meeting in louisville and didnt get back until late today so jeff sessions didnt have a chance to look at this   and we were told earlier today that this process was moving very slowly i think you know to be quite candid here jeff sessions was in politically for himself a nowin situation this is somebody who had been   andrew mccabe had been criticized repeatedly by name by the president so if   no matter what happened   and also people were well aware of jeff sessions own desire to please the president so no matter what he did if he said mccabe should be fired as he has done theyll be people criticizing him for that if he said mccabe shouldnt be fired that would not please the white house i mean it took   put him in a tough position but thats the job  pete williams thank you very much for joining us tonight with this breaking news williams via telephone  yes sir  attorney general jeff sessions firing the former acting director of the fbi andrew mccabe just two days before andrew mccabes retirement date was to become official were now joined by harry litman former us attorney and a deputy assistant attorney general under president clinton also ned price former senior director and spokesperson for the national security council and a former cia analyst ruth marcus deputy editorial page editor and columnist at  the washington post  as well as david cay johnston pulitzer pricewinning journalist and author of  its even worse than you think  what the trump administration is doing to america  we have a panel who has seen everything harry litman i want to go to you first youve worked in the justice department whats your reading of this  my reading is its a grave injustice   theres   petes reporting is accurate and there is a serious mark on mccabes record the record overall though is of 21 years of exemplary service and respect by everyone within the department what really stinks about this one is the rush to get this done by friday which could   was only motivated to in a petty way take his pension away from him compare this with john yoo the author of the torture memos the same thing happened to him opr recommended a certain discipline it then went to the attorney general yoo was given six months to write a long brief state his case to the attorney general which   who in fact did reduce the sentence the fact that mccabe was rushed into this presentation yesterday and sessions turns it around today i think is completely abnormal and was done only in order to be sure they could take away his pension before sunday  harry let me stay with you on this distinction because the case you just mentioned was not a member of the fbi is there within the justice department a different a higher standard for members of the fbi in situations like this which in the reports indicates did not tell the truth when he was questioned  the short answer is no mccabe was of a certain level that the attorney general himself needed to decide the issue but the overall procedural path from the ig   the same ig   to opr to the attorney general is the same it just happens that the opr in one instance is with the fbi and the other instance department of justice no reason at all to do it on this timeline except to maliciously take away this guys pension something that fbi agents really think about know about and are going to be shaken up about  ned price your reaction to this  well   i would agree with harry something about this smells very fishy and its more than just the timing its more than the fact that this comes just 48 hours or so before his retirement would kick in its more than the fact that this takes place on a friday night at 10 00 pm eastern time its also the fact that this takes place separate and apart from the release of the inspector general report the inspector general report on andrew mccabe in the broader hillary clinton matter as i understand it has been completed for a while now its been undergoing review so why rush this why has it aggregated to pull out the andy mccabe information fire him well before it seems the ig report is going to be released we also have to remember the point you raised before the information andy mccabe is accused of giving to  the wall street journal  was very damning was very troubling for the clinton campaign it did not look good there were previous instances of top trump officials giving information to news outlets that is exculpatory for the trump people that looks good for them they have never taken fire from that mike pompeo it has been welldocumented on at least one occasion   and i highly suspect there have been more   have reached out early on in the administration to news outlets to tamp down these rumors at the time that there may have been rampant connections between the trump campaign and the russians we now know that to be true mike pompeo was not disciplined in fact mike pompeo was just nominated to be the secretary of state so i suspect that if what andy mccabe had done was give information that was exculpatory towards the trump campaign we would be seeing a very different outcome here as it stands this looks more like anything than a purge  andy mccabe has given just a couple of comments to  the new york times  tonight and he is saying that he believes his firing by jeff sessions tonight was   is intended to affect the special prosecutors investigation and particularly andrew mccabes credibility in that conversation   in that investigation he said the idea that i was dishonest is just wrong this is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness and of course he means as a witness in the mueller investigation he went on to say   andrew mccabe did   its incredibly unfair to my reputation after a 21year career the real damage is being done to the fbi law enforcement and the special counsel david cay johnston your reaction to this breaking news   well first of all i agree with both the lawyers that this is extraordinary there is a long history of people in the fbi doing things they shouldnt do and getting full official reports that sort of take care of them but donald has a long history of going on the attack if he is accused of anything he learned from roy cohn you go on the attack and so he needs to try and discredit and suppress the mueller investigation and one of the things that will help him do that is to try and make andrew mccabe appear to be less credible thats exactly what this is about exactly and it sends a secondary signal from this white house which is you do your job as a law enforcement agent and its going to cause me trouble as president well get you  harry litman theres another striking coincidence in this breaking news tonight there is a   theres what would have been the massive breaking news of the night which is the president of the united states actively engaging in trying to move a lawsuit by stormy daniels out of a state court in california into a federal court the court where the president appoints the judges that story now is competing with this new breaking news story the president has not tweeted about his legal move tonight that he is a part of to try to move the stormy daniels case into federal court but he has just tweeted about andrew mccabe i think we know which one of these stories he wants us to concentrate on he just tweeted fbi director andrew mccabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits this is actually a tweet that he did previously about this because the president was eager to get this done before this retirement date but its so striking that with the stormy daniels story breaking   in less than an hour after it broke that the president was trying to move that into federal court within the hour of that news breaking jeff sessions executes this firing  yes weve gotten pretty used to nasty business coming on friday afternoon or evening and here youre right we have a double dose of it i think he is going to want to tout the mccabe point which again serves only as a kind of petty gesture to   in favor of opponents of mccabe just stripping him of his pension for no good reason and he is going to want to dampen the fact that this motion requires him to acknowledge his role in the stormy daniels controversy he is   he has moved to take this case from state court to federal court in brief he has the right to do it and the whole idea here 100 percent is to try to use the arbitration clause in the hush money contract to keep her from talking and his prospects are going to be a little bit better in federal court because federal judges he not only appoints them but theyre well known to be more welldisposed to the sort of arbitration clause that he wants to use as a sword here  ruth marcus is joining us  the washington post  columnist ruth the stormy daniels lawsuit we just got the filing on it just before we were going on the air tonight and then minutes later we get this firing by jeff sessions the stormy daniels lawsuit that the president is now actively engaged in threatens stormy daniels with  20 million in damages thats specified by the president and the presidents lawyer in the filing that they issued tonight and then jeff sessions comes along right after that with this firing  so if i were stormy daniels lawyer i would tell her to sit tight and dont worry what number the president and his lawyers are coming up with to threaten her with if she wants to talk theyre not going to be able to stop her from talking we do not have prior restraint in this country for porn actresses talking about their relationships with a president if he wants to sue her and she can then go and depose him and have a lawsuit and have discovery let them go ahead and do that i actually really dont understand the presidents legal strategy which seems to be bringing maximum attention to stormy daniels rather   which he insists she has no credible story to tell he has just guaranteed that everybody is going to be tuning in to a certain other network to see her talk so on that i want to descend slightly just a little bit on andrew mccabes story just for this reason its totally clear and its really upsetting and very disturbing that the president has been gunning for andrew mccabe since the campaign hes been gunning to get his pension taken away from him this kind of friday night massacre is a little concerning on the other hand i do know the inspector general at the justice department if it is true that he concluded that andrew mccabes conduct was serious enough to warrant firing you cant fire the guy well after he retires i just want to know a little bit more about the underlying conduct before i go sort of whole hog with the rest of the crew in completely decrying this i am concerned by it i dont like to see somebody whos worked for the government his entire life stripped of his pension and theres this magnificent shakespearean quality to all of this right because if andrew mccabe is fired and   as he was fired and if he loses his pension as a result it will be because he leaked something that was harmful to hillary clinton the guy who the president kept describing as a proclinton schill so theres just a certain magnificence to it  harry litman  ironic magnificence  thank you ruth i want to go to harry litman on this as a former justice department employee the inspector general who made this recommendation is a career employee he is not a trump appointee he served in the obama administration served in   under the bush administration before that he has served both democrat and republican administrations so this is not someone who was   had any apparent bias on the trump side  look i agree michael horwitz is his name he is   he has a wellearned reputation for professionalism and thoroughness and he put his finger on mccabe disputes whether   mccabe was candid but horwitz judged otherwise my push back against ruth i take her point just has to do with the timing of this notwithstanding when his retirement would have been its just 100 percent clear this was driven by political pressure from the white house for the petty reason of stripping him of his pension thats wrong thats not the way its supposed to work  i just want to repeat what andrew mccabe said to  the new york times  tonight he said the idea that i was dishonest is just wrong he said this is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness and david cay johnston he means as a witness in the special prosecutors investigation he is a witness to among other things we know hes a witness to the comey firing in that we know that james comey spoke to him about what the president said to him and so when james comey is presented as a witness describing what the president said and did to him andrew mccabe is part of that  yes and comey did exactly what you should do in that situation he immediately went and wrote a note memorializing the conversation and courts tend to get give a lot of credence to immediately memorialized observations and then he brought in his top people including mccabe to discuss this and the significance of it partly to make a record with them but also partly to make sure that he had correctly interpreted and thought about his options in dealing with this so its important to trump in his effort to discredit mueller to try and knock off witnesses wherever he can and take away their legitimacy  joining us now  by the way   if i can just quickly say the horowitz that is not finished the bigger topic of it is what comey did with respect to the clinton investigation when he came out and said it was extremely careless of her it may well be that horowitz will yet also impugn comey in his broader report  joining the discussion now by phone is ben wittes hes the editorinchief of  lawfare  he also knows some of the players involved in this controversy including james comey ben wittes your reaction to attorney general jeff sessions tonight firing former acting director of the fbi andrew mccabe two days before his official retirement date benjamin wittes editorinchief lawfare via telephone  im very saddened by it and i wish very much that the resolution of this had been otherwise for the sake of everybody involved particularly for andy mccabe who you know i still dont understand and have not seen a factual record that would justify this i understand that there is an inspector general report that has you know suggested that he engaged in you know conduct that justifies this action but the nature of precisely what he was supposed to have done and what the evidence of that remains entirely opaque to the public and you know as far as i can tell andy mccabe is somebody who served with a lot of honor and dignity under exceptionally difficult circumstances and so until i see   excuse me until i see a record that would justify this action taken two days before he was due to retire by   you know in the face of presidential tweets demanding his scalp i will you know regard it as an action that may be very difficult to justify and that said i will reserve judgment until i see what the inspector general has said and what i see when   what i   whatever i see andy has responded to that and so that i understand what the parameters of the dispute really are  the only response we have from andrew mccabe at this point is a comment he made to  the new york times  tonight and he said the idea that i was dishonest is just wrong this is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness and ben wittes he   obviously he means as a witness in the mueller investigation what is your reaction to that wittes via telephone  well i mean he is a witness in that investigation at least on the question of corroborating jim comeys claims about his interactions with donald trump and so to the extent that the fbi has concluded   or the inspector general has concluded that he was not honest with their investigation that would have a discrediting effect in the context of a different investigation whether its justifiable or not of course depends on the evidence that the public doesnt have access to right now  andrew mccabe has apparently just released a statement tonight its a rather lengthy one i will try to read some of it   actually im going to start reading it ned price as you start   give us your reaction again to this to the possibility that this is actually the timing of this is related to the mueller investigation because andrew mccabe is obviously a witness in that investigation as ben wittes just said a corroborating witness to james comey and if you can get him fired from his job for being untruthful that would have an effect on his credibility as a witness  well i think thats exactly right   we know from what director comey has said what he has written that he shared his encounters those encounters where president trump may well have at least attempted to obstruct justice that he shared those encounters with a very small group of people all of whom have now been either sidelined or fired and in the case of andy mccabe he of course was sidelined weeks ago and now his firing i suspect as andy mccabe himself is saying was to undermine his credibility as a fact witness as ben was alluding to the other point i think we have to remember here though   is that we havent heard from michael horowitz the inspector general we have heard from jeff sessions the attorney general someone who of course is not unbiased and we dont have to go that far back in history in fact only to this week to recall what happened to rex tillerson and the account   the differing accounts that we heard from the white house and what we heard from the state department the white house put out a statement leading all of us to believe that rex tillerson knew this was coming that he knew that his time was up but the state department it seems in a bit of candor that actually led to an individuals firing said that this took him completely by surprise so im not sure we can give this full credence and credibility knowing that jeff sessions has squandered a lot of his credibility and i frankly want to hear from michael horowitz    theres also an issue here of proportionality were not talking about andrew mccabe having paid somebody off not to tell a story were not talking about him having screwed up cases of the fbis were talking about how he handled an effort to deal with a journalist who had a story they thought was wrong so the punishment here is totally out of proportion to the action even if he was not fully candid  lets hear from andrew mccabe this is his written statement that has just been released i will read portions of it he says for the last year and a half my family and i have been the targets of an unrelenting assault on our reputation and my service to this country articles too numerous to count have leveled every sort of false defamatory and degrading allegations against us the presidents tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all he called for my firing he called for me to be stripped of my pension after more than 20 years of service and all along we have said nothing never wanting to distract from the mission of the fbi by addressing the lies told and repeated about us no more the investigation by the justice departments office of inspector general has to be understood in the context of the attacks on my credibility the investigation flows from my attempt to explain the fbis involvement and my supervision of investigations involving hillary clinton i was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan accused of closing down investigations under political pressure the fbi was portrayed as caving under that pressure and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes nothing was further from the truth in fact this entire investigation stems from my efforts fully authorized under fbi rules to set the record straight on behalf of the bureau and to make clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in doj opposed the oig investigation has focused on information i chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and legal counselor as deputy director i was one of the   one of only a few people who had the authority to do that it was not a secret it took place over several days and others including the director were aware of the interaction with the reporter it was the type of exchange with the media that the deputy director oversees several times per week in fact it was the same type of work that i continue to do under director wray at his request the investigation subsequently focused on who i talked to when i talked to them and so forth during those inquiries i answered questions truthfully and as accurately as i could amidst the chaos that surrounded me and when i thought my answers were misunderstood i contacted investigators to correct them but looking at that in isolation completely misses the big picture the big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized public servants are attacked and people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people and harry litman i want to get your reaction to that much of andrew mccabes statement  its true its tragic the broader story here   first on mccabe the broader story as ben and ned say is one of exemplary public service respected across the   from everybody and an unfair tarring but this broader theme that he sounds at the end of his statement politicization of law enforcement is just nauseating and its continued and continued what theyre trying to do to him now   trump had his press secretary go out and call mccabe to america a bad actor today its reminiscent of the defamation that they visited on comey when he was fired and they said falsely the whole fbi had turned against him this kind of assault on independent law enforcement by the white house for the small ends of trying to affect the investigation against the president is really dangerous and toxic  i want to read one more passage of andrew mccabes written statement tonight he says here is the reality i am being singled out and treated this way because of the role i played the actions i took and the events i witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of james comey the release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the house intelligence committee revealed that i would corroborate former director comeys accounts of his discussions with the president the oigs focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the administration driven by the president himself to remove me from my position destroy my reputation and possibly strip me of a pension that i worked 21 years to earn the accelerated release of the report and the punitive actions taken in response make sense only when viewed through this lens thursdays comments from the white house are just the latest example of this this attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally but to taint the fbi law enforcement and intelligence professionals more generally it is part of this administrations ongoing war on the fbi and the efforts of the special counsel investigation which continue to this day their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the special counsels work ben wittes your reaction to andrew mccabe saying that the reality here is that he is being singled out he said i am being singled out and treated this way because of the role i played the actions i took and the events i witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of james comey wittes via telephone  look we dont know what the underlying evidence that the ig has reported about andrew mccabe is we do know that the singling out of the deputy fbi director by the president of the united states on a repeated basis is a unique event in the history of the united states we do know that firing a longserving fbi official two days before he is due to retire anyway is a highly unusual matter and we do know that the political pressure on the justice department to do that was extreme so i cant say that you know andy mccabes protestations of innocence of whatever it is the inspector general has found about him are accurate i can say that the situation stinks and as i said before i will evaluate the evidence that supposedly justifies this action at the point in which it becomes public and until then look a lot of what andy mccabe is saying in that statement is just plainly true  and ruth marcus as ben just said we dont have the inspector generals report but we have andrew mccabes written response to it at this first stage of this news and im going to zero in on the sentences in which andrew mccabe is directly dealing with what must be in that inspector generals report he says during these inquiries i answered questions truthfully and as accurately as i could amidst the chaos that surrounded me and when i thought my answers were misunderstood i contacted investigators to correct them and ruth when we get to read the inspector generals report i believe there will be several pages that describe what andrew mccabe is describing there and well have to hold one against the other  right and two things can simultaneously be true and ben put this well when he was describing it it is absolutely clear   name another deputy director of the fbi who was  became a household name he became a household name because he was attacked by first presidential candidate donald trump and then president donald trump and he is   and he was attacked and i would submit probably fired for largely political reasons and i would throw in there the absolutely shameful singling out that sarah huckabee sanders did of him from the podium yesterday but this episode that he alludes to you know its part of this behind the scenes dance thats a really necessary part of washington that goes on where on background officials guide reporters to help reporters get their stories more accurate to make sure that things are not written that are unfair to subjects or targets of an investigation this is a dance that has to go on that needs to go on behind the scenes but something happened there that i   that at least it sounds like the inspector general found wasnt exactly right and something then seemed to have happened with mccabes testimony that the inspector general i suspect had a problem with so the fury that mccabe has about the politicization of the fbi and about his being fired i totally get i dont want to say that its clear that his conduct has been completely above reproach because it feels like its a much more complicated story than that  and david cay johnston it seems like andrew mccabe has a lot more that were probably eventually going to hear about this and i think were so lucky that we have experts from the   with justice department experience here as well as reporters because this is a report   this is a journalism story too and mccabe is in trouble because of communication with  the wall street journal  with reporters mccabe describes that in his written statement tonight as his job  right yes  he says this is one of the things that the deputy fbi director is charged with doing clarifying for the press when possible what the fbi is doing or what its not doing and so he says here that he has done this   he said it was the type of exchange with the media that the deputy director oversees several times a week in fact it was the same type of work that i continued to do under director wray at his request so he is saying the trumpappointed fbi director had him doing exactly the same thing with the press  yes you get to see the knife with that one  yes  well this is exactly how this stuff works and of course the fbi and other agencies are concerned they dont want a reporter who has a story to mess up their investigation witnesses can be affected by these things and no we dont know exactly what mccabe did but i think theres a very pregnant line there about how when he evidently felt that the people who questioned him didnt get his answers the way he intended he set out to correct them now unless theres something showing that he was mendacious and obviously so it would seem to suggest that he may have been to some degree set up or   and he certainly clearly indicates he believes he was trying to make the record as accurate as possible  and describes in his first round of trying to remember truthful answers about this he says he was doing the best he could  amidst the chaos that surrounded me  and i think we all have a feel for what that must have been were joined now by phone by jill winebanks shes a former assistant watergate special prosecutor and shes an msnbc contributor and jill i wish you could be on camera because we could see your st patricks green again which i saw earlier tonight that you are wearing but jill i want to get your reaction to this story at first we began simply with the fact that jeff sessions at 10 00 pm tonight approximately on a friday night fired andrew mccabe the former acting director of the fbi with only two days left before his official retirement we now have a full written statement by andrew mccabe that ive been reading here your reaction to what we know about this so far jill winebanks former assistant watergate special prosecutor via telephone  well first of all let me say we take st patricks day very seriously in chicago so thats why  i know you do laughter winebanks via telephone  yes  i know you do winebanks via telephone  but on a serious note i mean at 10 00 pm on a friday night before his sunday retirement becomes effective does throw some doubt into the credibility and reasons for the action i do agree of course with ben that we need to have all the evidence before we pass judgment on what the recommendation was we need to see the ig report i also think that his statement the mccabe statement is a very persuasive and compelling one that id like to know more about the background of and i wonder whether the president realizes that all of these people that he fires now have no reason not to cooperate fully with mueller and to speak out and whether people are realizing how much distraction is happening in the chaos at the white house from the mueller investigation from the stormy daniels investigation and from the overall effect of trying to taint the fbi and mueller and the department of justice and whether mccabe has been denied due process i cannot believe that hes already had a hearing that would be entitled to any senior service person such as himself before he gets fired he hasnt had a chance to defend himself and tell his side of the story so i dont think we should jump to conclusions that hes innocent or that hes guilty we need to see the full evidence and in the context of this president and how they have attacked not just mccabe but the entire fbi and the department of justice and mueller it makes me suspicious it makes me suspicious and makes me wonder about the truth of it  harry litman i want to go to one of the points that andrew mccabe raises which he believes that this is a design to damage his credibility as a witness in the mueller investigation whats your reaction to that  well its true and thats probably what   i mean trump has that in mind as a practical goal it seems to me he just has the more petty mind   goal in mind of just gratuitously taking away the pension of someone who has crossed him to me  but harry can  yes  can i ask you to focus as a legal practitioner  sure    on the actual practical effect of this  yes    on the perceived credibility of andrew mccabe as a witness going forward if you were in the special prosecutors office and you had the mccabe file you were in charge of him as a witness going forward how would you feel tonight  look you know i would feel only a little worse there are all kinds of people they   that they use that will some impeachment material but yes here is how it all will be he will testify if it comes to a proceeding that comey told him exactly what comey said he said and then the defense attorney will say oh is that right well are you aware   isnt it true mr mccabe that you were found to have committed misconduct isnt it true that you were fired et cetera et cetera and that impeachment will have whatever value it has in front of a jury i just want to say here though that its true as ben and ruth says that part of whats going on   we of course dont know exactly what he did and its very odd that horowitz found these things but i just i think its all secondary next to two points whatever he did the timing of his being railroaded out is indefensible and political and most important of all the political themes of demonization of law enforcement that he sounds at the end of his statement that those really should be i think the headline for us as a country  i have already brought up the timing coincidence that as we went into this hour of television i believed that our hotter breaking news tonight was going to be about the presidents attempt to move stormy daniels lawsuit into federal court i want to switch focus to that because its hard to believe that the timing is coincidental tonight that the president did   was not paying attention to what was happening in this news cycle and how this announcement could change that the president of the united states is actually asking a federal court in california to take jurisdiction of stormy daniels lawsuit against donald trump the president of the united states is asking the federal court to take the lawsuit away from a california state court and tonights legal filing in federal court in california by a california lawyer representing the president of the united states claims that stormy daniels lawsuit against donald trump should be moved from state court to federal court because stormy daniels is a resident of texas donald trump is a resident of washington dc and new york city and because of the multistate locations of the parties the case should not be heard in a california state court since none of the parties live in california the legal filing says that president trump and his lawyers are quote aware of at least 20 violations by clifford   thats stormy daniels real name   of the confidentiality provisions of this settlement agreement clifford expressly agreed in these settlement agreements to liquidated damages in the amount of  1 million for each breach of the confidentiality provisions which is approximated to already be in excess of  20 million we are joined by phone now by stormy daniels attorney michael avenatti and mr avenatti i know you learned about this when you were on a plane tonight what is your reaction to the president trying to move this case into federal court michael avenatti attorney for stormy daniels via telephone  well thanks for having me im not at all surprised we anticipated that the president and mr cohen might attempt to do this its really a prelude its an interim step if you will to where they really want to go which is arbitration they want this matter decided by a private arbitrator in a conference room in a private office building as opposed to a public courthouse thats open to the people where people can actually judge for themselves the facts and the evidence this is just more of the same i mean it is consistent with the way they have treated my client for some time now they have attempted to bully her and intimidate her and ultimately they do not want this matter public its just that simple this is more of the same their attempts to gag and muzzle my client and were not going to stand for it  its a really striking legal filing to see because there you see the name of the president of the united states on the title page of this pleading in federal court and the name of the president of the united states typed in there by his lawyer also has an alias beside it typed in there by his lawyer the president of the united states has a lawyer who refers to him as donald j trump also known as david dennison that is how the presidents lawyer represents donald trump in this case a client with an alias trying to keep everything that stormy daniels knows about him secret avenatti via telephone  well i think what is truly remarkable about this   if we just take a step back and really think about this for a moment i actually think this is a remarkable moment in our nations history i dont think that there has ever been an instance   and i know thats a big statement but i stand behind it i dont think theres ever been an incident in the history of the united states where you have a sitting president who undertook a personal vendetta against a private us citizen  ok avenatti via telephone    who merely was  ok avenatti via telephone    who merely was looking for an opportunity to tell her version of events and is seeking  20 million worth of damages i dont think thats ever happened before in the history of the united states its frightening quite honestly  now your client has already spoken to  60 minutes   60 minutes  has announced that they intend to broadcast that interview on i believe march 25th that presumably by the presidents definition will constitute what he considers another breach or another several breaches of this agreement so according to the presidents reading of the situation do you expect at the end of the broadcast of the  60 minutes  interview for stormy daniels in the presidents view to be liable for another  20 million or  100 million avenatti via telephone  no we dont i mean the president also thinks he won the popular vote so you know i dont know what to say but look this  20 million demand or  20 million claim in damages is laughable and you know next i guess well hear  50 or  100 or  200 million its an absolute joke we dont believe the agreement is going to be upheld and even if the agreement is upheld that liquated damages clause it will never be upheld because it is what is called legally conscionable which means even if the parties agreed to it and even if they read it and understood it inaudible   confident that no court will enforce a million dollars liquidated inaudible especially when the consideration monetarily was only  130000 so this pie in the sky its a bullying tactic its designed to intimidate my client and i and clearly they havent been paying attention over the last who weeks were not going to pack up and go home were not going to dismiss the case shes not going to prevent the  60 minutes  piece from hiring were going to let the chips fall where they may were going to continue to strive to tell the american people what happened here and were going to allow them to make a determination on who is shooting straight with them and who is not and its that simple  and mr avenatti i just want to go over one more point before you go and you know you got a lot of attention this morning on this network on  morning joe  when in an answer to questions youve said that stormy daniels has been threatened and that she has been physically threatened has she been threatened by anyone representing or connected to the president avenatti via telephone  again im not at liberty to discuss that im confident that when people tune in to  60 minutes  on the 25th of march theyre going to learn the details surrounding that threat or the threats and they are going to judge for themselves as to whether she is telling the truth and whether shes credible and at some point mr cohen and the president are going to have to account for their various actions associated with attempting to silence my client and i am counting the days  did michael cohen threaten stormy daniels avenatti via telephone  im going to stand by my same answer  and when were those threats when were the most recent threats avenatti via telephone  im not at liberty to discuss the details of the threats again i think when people tune in to the interview theyre going to learn about it  michael avenatti really appreciate you calling in i know this was difficult for you to do i really appreciate it thank you very much really appreciate it avenatti via telephone  no problem have a good weekend thank you  thank you and our legal panel is still here everyone who has been covering and following both of these i want to go to ruth marcus first because this   before we even get to the legalisms of it i just want us to pause over the fact that we live in a country where the president of the united states has a lawyer type his name in a legal pleading and then type his alias in right beside it and file that legal pleading in a federal court in a courthouse where the president appoints the judges  well yes and you know  it has been quite a day of stormy daniels news as you pointed out trying to get a little bit more information on what this threat and physical threat was and who it came from and i am just thinking about where we are and where weve been and my reporting career spans the clarence thomas anita hill hearings where we thought we heard things that we could never get into our newspapers back in those days when certain words werent allowed and we managed to report all of that in our newspapers and then we went to impeachment and bill clinton and blue dresses and all sorts of other things that didnt seem fit for a family audience and we got those into our newspapers and now here we are with a president and a porn star and its a kind of dreary trajectory of the kind of   of modern politics and the craziness of this moment and just the sordid nature of what were all being dragged into writing about when there are actually serious problems facing the country there are serious policy issues to be decided and were talking about porn stars and threats and presidential aliases so im just throwing up my hands here  understandable david cay johnston no one on this panel knows more about donald trump as a litigant than you do youve watched him both be a phony bluffer  im not hearing anything    as he was when he threatened to sue me  right  and i begged him to sue me because i knew he was bluffing youve seen him actually sue people youve seen him cave youve seen him settle  25 million on trump university what do you make of this filing tonight and is this the first one youve seen where he includes an alias beside his name  yes its absolutely the first ive seen with an alias and this is extraordinary now of course in making this filing they basically acknowledge that this relationship went on and there was a hush money payment but this again is donalds bullying and going on the attack and ive done as you have you know i was   ive talked about donald and the drug trafficker and said donald you know if you think what ive said isnt true sue me over it one of the interesting things about this case is the removal to federal court the 1925 arbitration act was passed to allow corporations in different states to settle dispute it was never intended to apply to disputes between individuals between individuals and companies if it were put up today in congress it would never pass if it was going to apply to you and me if we were in a dispute and the lawyers on the panel are quite right that the federal courts have a different inclination about this than the state courts but this is not a dispute that should be allowed under the 1925 federal arbitration act because were not talking about two corporations we have one and   created solely for the purpose of helping they thought hide the money  let me go to one of my lawyers jill winebanks your reaction to what stormy daniels lawyer michael avenatti just have to say winebanks via telephone  well first of all i would say he is doing a wonderful job of representing her and making her look better than the president and david is quite correct that we now have absolute proof that dd is president trump which is i think an unforced error on the part of his lawyers who didnt think two steps ahead when they filed this suit i think michael was quite correct avenatti in saying something about the inequitability of this for  130000 payment she agreed to pay  1 million per every breach that is not only unconscionable just under the norm frames of contract law you cant enforce a contract that is so inequitable we have a principle just in general that that isnt enforceable and as to your earlier question about whether the credibility of mccabe is so severely hurt its certainly no worse than flynn and the others who have plead guilty to lying and who will now be the witnesses against the president and all of them are now free to tell the truth about the president so again its bad thinking on the part of the presidents lawyers to have gotten into the situation where theyre allowing this to happen i really am just astounded at the bad lawyering on his part and   but they have been effective in distracting us as ruth said from policy from his bragging about lying to the prime minister of canada something for which we should be all be apologizing to our neighbors to the north theres so much other things of importance and the people of america can hardly keep track from day to day of whats important and so nothing sticks  jill winebanks gets tonights last word weaving it all together thank you   ned price h'"

       "'      this is a rush transcript from   may 18 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated  all right thanks tucker  welcome to     we have breaking news all over the place tonight  the deep state abuse of power that we have been uncovering for over a year is even tonight far worse than any of us could have ever imagined this is watergate on steroids  remember the nixon scandal it was about a thirdrate burglary this is a deep state political hit job now spying on an opposition party campaign fbi spies during an election     and it gets worse the deep state isnt even trying to hide it and what they did they are now bragging about it  the former obama director of national intelligence james clapper is actually saying spying on the trump campaign was a good thing has he ever heard of the constitution were going to unpack all the stunning new details tonight now it will make you question how this could ever happen in the united states of america  and also tonight a deep state source smear this is pretty unreal liberal media anonymous government sources falsely accusing the president and republicans and conservatives of endangering the life of the fbi informant you know the one spying for the fbi on the trump campaign do they have a warrant its also revealing critical information about who this person really is  and tonight the speaker of the house paul ryan he is now telling the special counsel wrap up this corrupt investigation now also tonight we have sad news out of texas the president reacting to yet another tragic school shooting we will explain why it is time for this country to get serious when it comes to protecting our precious children there is an answer well explain the solution  we have that and more in tonights important breaking news opening monologue  all right major developments again tonight on the deep state  spying on the trump campaign james clapper barack obamas former director of national intelligence is actually today saying it was a good thing that the trump campaign had a spy for the fbi in their campaign during an election i cant believe it  watch it  they may have had someone who was talking to them in the campaign but you know the focus here and as it was with the intelligence community is not on the campaign per se but what the russians were doing to try to substantiate themselves in the campaign or to influence or leverage it so if there was someone that was observing that sort of thing thats a good thing  yes where was the spy in the hillary campaign where she did pay for russian lies  clapper so pompous so arrogant this is so illegal he is actually bragging about surveilling an opposition party during a presidential election year if thats the case this is not america we dont have a constitution this is something youd expect from the former soviet union venezuela  and again youve got clappers buddy john brennan who is also up to his eyeballs in this scandal probably knows a lot about it since  remember he is the guy that voted for a communist for president  last night we had the great one mark levin reacting to all of this his analysis dead spot on take a look  we have a cabal of fbi agents who took it on themselves to investigate a candidate and his campaign and then we have of course actual spies one or more in the trump campaign what the hell is this the soviet union venezuela its the united states of america  i want to know what brennan did i want to know what clapper did i want to know what comey did not because im going to punish them you will make determinations about them  susan rice  but something  something is terribly wrong  we need to fix this we cannot have another election where the federal government our united states government is interfering with an election  the great one is right we have been right everyone on the program has been right we need to fix it because this is about the constitution of the united states its literally hanging in the balance at this hour  you have unelected deep state actors shredding our fourth amendment rights your right to privacy and protection against unreasonable search and seizure  this is as ive been telling you one of the darkest chapters in american history the trump campaign is targeted because people like clapper brennan comey and others they think they knew better than you did the american people about who should be the president they weaponized the powerful tools of intelligence turned it on us and they are now politicizing differences political differences  by the way clapper since you are so concerned about russia influence in the election did you have a spy in the clinton campaign now we know for a fact her campaign was colluding had a foreign agent christopher steele paying for russian lies and propaganda to lie to the american people  clinton and the dnc remember they paid over what  12 million for the russian dossier full of russian lies where is the fbi where is the cia where are the spies  of course there werent any instead of investigating it well they used former spy christopher steele who they fired as a trusted source and they used false completely unverified never corroborated  a dossier he put together to get a warrant and then spy on the trump campaign never tell the judges she paid for it and then in the process lying to the fisa court judges on four separate occasions never revealing hillary paid for all of this  this is the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal we have seen in the history of this country talk about watergate this is watergate on steroids and human growth hormone  watergate what was a third rate breakin that eventually forced president to resign you may remember this  to continue to fight for the months ahead for my personal vindication with almost totally absorb the time and the attention of both the president and the congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issue of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home therefore i shall resign presidency effective at noon tomorrow  what is playing out right now is nothing compared to watergate spying on an opposition party during an election it makes watergate look like stealing a candy bar from a candy store  now here is why  now the details of this abuse of power are so far worse the new york times now confirming this week everything we have been telling you now the times didnt all of a sudden decide oh we want to tell people the truth this is about actively now assisting the deep state and what the times is doing is theyre helping these bad actors get in front of the scandal because they know its coming out they are spinning the facts and crafting their own narrative  now to steal a page from the fbis playbook well they now know crossfire hurricane is coming now here is why  the deep state is about to be exposed its all happening  now a portion of the doj report is set to come out in a couple of weeks congress  well theyll eventually get the documents that led up to the ig report well see it all now the doj is now slowly leaking this information to friendly news outlets like the washington post and the new york times  heres what theyre now reporting is corroborating everything we have been uncovering lets run through the details starting with this quote the fbi obtained phone records other documents using national security letters a secret type of subpoena officials said and at least one government informant ie spy met several times with mr page and mr papadopoulos and current and former officials say  that confirms the fbi had a spy an informant that infiltrated the trump campaign where is the warrant and in addition to lying to the four fisa judges four times to get the fisa warrant to spy on the trump campaign the fbi is using secret spies was there another secret subpoena  it sounds like the deep state was using every option available to go after the trump campaign by the way after they of course rigged the hillary investigation here is another significant quote that matches our reporting days after they closed their investigation into hillary clintons use of a private email server agents began scrutinizing the campaign of her republican rival  now the times adds that both these investigations were made up of a small group of the same top officials so the same officials that rigged the clinton email investigation even though we know she broke laws and obstructed justice well then they went after donald trump and set their sights on him  now next now is this shocking part that directly implicates here john kerry and barack obama nobody has picked up on this top australian officials broke with diplomatic protocol allowed the ambassador alexander downer to sit for an fbi interview to describe his meeting with campaign adviser george papadopoulos all right diplomatic protocol broken  that means john kerry from the getgo this is the beginning the obama state department and im sure the president that means obama all involved that means they knew about the spying from the start  and as we have been saying for months john kerry barack obama need to answer two simple questions what did you both know and when did you both know it now these are other disturbing details in this  now these deep state sources revealed to the new york times that four trump campaign associates were being investigated by the fbi it wasnt just carter page and george papadopoulos whoever he is the fbi was also going after general michael flynn and paul manafort from the getgo this was a major intelligence operation  and finally these unnamed sources tried to spin that peter strzok lisa page text messages what they were talking about who we now think is andrew mccabe about their socalled insurance policy in case the unthinkable happened and donald trump won they are absolutely claiming now quote they said anything the fbi did publicly would only give fodder to mr trump campaign claims that the election was rigged  now mr strzok countered that even if trumps chances of victory were low like dying before you are 40 the stakes are too high to justify inaction  well thats laughable and it proves our point the deep state these top players not rank and file desperately trying to spin all of this damning all of this incriminating evidence  now another new breaking story to tell you about tonight anonymous government sources have been repeatedly leaking to the media details about the fbi informant who did spy on the trump campaign and at the same time they are accusing president republicans even people like me of putting this informants life in danger i have known his name for a full week  heres the latest example from washington post  bigger than watergate  trump joins push by allies to expose the role of an fbi source  they are falsely smearing not only the president and congressional republicans and yours truly no we are trying to conduct an investigation congress is they have constitutional oversight authority they are supposed to do this  in the process washington post as bias as they are is revealing key details who the person is for example the source is a us citizen and has provided information over the years to both the fbi and the cia as the post previously reported and aided the russia investigation both before and after muellers appointment of may 2017 according to people familiar with these activities ok on the basis of this its ridiculous and for the record the persons name has been out there in the media ive known for over a week and by the way its not some closely held state secret what is withholding now or unfolding before our eyes is utter insanity and the total hypocrisy on display for the whole country to see  you got the doj fbi are accusing the president republicans people like me of endangering a source at the same time anonymous law enforcement intel officials they are the ones leaking the details about who the informant is that is what we call a deliberative smear  now here is point number two this is really important these unnamed federal officials have leaked more information to the new york times and washington post than they have given to congress because they are trying to get a friendly audience and remember rod rosenstein has been slow walking obstructing stonewalling every congressional attempt to do their constitutional authority of oversight every chance he gets  when rosenstein does actually comply well he turned over what heavily redacted information in the claims of national security well we have seen that is just a lie its not true look at these leaks about the fbi informant you know what would they really be doing this if it was a national security threat  this is about getting out in front of congress in front of the ig in front of what they know is coming they are trying to control the narrative slowly bleed it out it has nothing to do with national security  just like rosenstein redacting the fact that james comey didnt think that general flynn lied to the fbi neither did anyone else in the fbi it had nothing to do with national security that was a cya and rosenstein protecting his corrupt friends he and jeff sessions they either need to go or do their job  also tonight the president reacting to this horrible shooting yes another sad school shooting this time in texas earlier today lets take a look  unfortunately i have to begin by expressing our sadness and heartbreak over the deadly shooting at santa fe high school in texas it has been going on too long in our country too many years too many decades now we grieve for the terrible loss of life and send our support and love everyone affected by this absolutely horrific attack to the students families teachers and personnel at santa fe high we are with you in this tragic hour and we will be with you forever  very sad and this has to stop and our prayers and thoughts do go to the families in texas they lost their children  now trace gallagher is going to have a full report in a few minutes as we have been saying on this program its so far beyond time that everything be done to protect our kids in school its simple we can solve this this is not a political issue  harden up the schools every school in this country needs a full threat security assessment every school we have to secure the perimeter and the entry points of every school we must require a mandate ids for anyone walking into a school metal detectors in every single school  and we need to hire retired concealed carry police officers retired military members and we should have two on every floor of every school in america thats what i think is the simple answer  and heres an idea by the way in case youre interested in new ideas these people work 15 hours retired military and retired police concealed carry lets them give them federal state local tax break as incentives so it wont cost a lot of money  its not political it shouldnt be political we protect our athletes we protect our politicians we protect those on the red carpet how about we do this for our kids lets do it in their best interest we have more coming up later in the program  another disturbing scene to tell you about this one taking place at trump national doral golf course where police officers had to shoot a deranged man in his legs earlier today after he reported started yelling antitrump rhetoric and opened fire inside of the resort police are saying this lunatic wanted to lure officers into an ambushstyle attack thank god they were able to stop this particular nut case  all right joining us now with reaction to our top story fox news contributor sara carter judicial watch president tom fitton and the author attorney david limbaugh  full disclosure david has negotiated every single radio and tv contract and book contract of my career and i usually pay for dinner  look sara this has been a huge week here what james clapper said ok is basically we dont have a country were not about the rule of law theres no constitutional protections anymore in this country  pretty much what hes saying is and remember clapper is begin investigated for leaking by congress so they believe james clapper was the one that actually delivered the information to cnn after the president was briefed on the dossier by comey at trump tower so clapper has a lot to answer for  but basically what clapper is saying is like look we weaponized the intelligence community to spy on a campaign because we were concerned about the russians but   what about the  500000 that clinton got for a speech in 2010 for a speech he gave to renaissance capital which by the way is very wellconnected to the kgb fsb russian fsb by this bank  did they have spies with bill clinton at the time were people investigating the clintons and the clinton foundation during that time i dont think so  this is a very wellorchestrated it appears plan to spy on a presidential campaign and it was very well partisan it involves brennan it involves clapper it involves foreign assets it involves us assets  i think we are only seeing the top of this iceberg id like to see this unravel and i have a lot of questions about what was going on in england at the time and the united kingdom  you have a lot of reporting i know is coming as you have been telling me  look david look at this from the legal side this is a politically target targeted they didnt have spies in hillary campaign they didnt have fisa warrants based on a trump dossier against hillary and lies to fisa warrant weaponizing the powerful tools of intelligence lying to the fisa court judges to target one political candidate in favor of one political candidate who did commit crimes who did pay for russian propaganda it is the biggest most twisted boomerang ive ever seen in my life  yes   if what clapper says is true that it was an innocuous investigation to find out what involvement russia had then why would they have bent over backwards as andy mccarthy says to avoid investigating hillary and indicting her and bend over forward to indict and implicate and deject president trump  how dangerous is this for the rule of law  why would they have deceived  yes why would they have deceived the fisa court if it was an innocent investigation and why would it present a flimsy evidence paid for by a clinton sponsored group and funneled through the law firm if it was necessary if it wasnt necessary if it was an innocent investigation why cant they just present real evidence  instead they deceive them as to the source as to the fact that steele had been fired by the fbi and as to the fact that sid blumenthal and others have provided information and it was a circular boot strapping of warrant application based on a report that steele has given to a news agency it was all so incestuous and all so corrupt  and why would comey have lied  such a good point  go ahead  and tom you cant have a dual system of justice or the hillary standard and the rest of us standard and then for the doj to slowwalk obstruct lie about national security as a reason for redactions clapper comments blow me away that means the rule of law does not exist in america what they did here that means they think they have unfettered power to do anything they want if they dont like a candidate  well thats true and going back to the investigation itself they were going all out against president trump or then candidate trump with this spy operation and recall from the last ig report which confirmed that the obama justice department at the same time was telling the fbi to stand down on any investigation in the clinton foundation which we know that the fbi and the doj knew full well was recipient of the money from russia to influence the positive outcome on the uranium one investigation  and just quickly  yes  lets get to the heart of this this is the mueller operation this  was it a counterintelligence investigation that began in 2016 that is being continued right now by mr mueller  sara lets give a preview of whats coming next week  sara carter whats coming next week  carter  yes well i think were going to have a lot more information on the inspector generals report were going to have more direction on that and also have a lot of stories coming on what was happening in london at the time  all right thanks great analysis we appreciate it  when we come back a live report on the mass shooting in texas from earlier today  also the liberal media is yet again rushing to politicize tragedy this is not political our kids shouldnt be political dr gorka and geraldo are with us  and later white house press secretary sarah sanders joins us about the abusively biased press in this country thats straight ahead  tragic school shooting took place yet again today this time in santa fe texas here are some of the chilling eyewitnesses to todays horrific events take a look  my friend got shot at art hall and as soon as the alarms went off everybody just started running outside and next thing you know everybody looks and you hear boom boom boom just run as fast as i could to the nearest forest so i can hide  we heard the guns ph go off and we started running but i turned back around and they were arresting somebody by the art class like in the back of the outside by the brick wall they are arresting somebody so i recorded that and i like left and ran i saw the other kids  so the fire alarm got pulled maybe it was just like pop something like explosion or something so i was like whatever but then i heard the next four shots and i was like no thats not an explosion thats a gunshot  we were sitting in class and we had our door open and the next thing i know we all heard a teacher run through the hallway and he goes dude in the building with a shotgun there is dude in the building with the shotgun  fortunately sadly but yet predictably it didnt take long for the liberal media to try to exploit this tragedy and push their gun control agenda take a look  political leadership you know wholly owned subsidiary of the gun lobby well take that issue on at least to some reasonable effect  i want to read you something before we bring in the next interview chris murphy of course the congressional district adjacent to newtown lets call it like it is the horrifying inaction of congress slaughter after slaughter has become a green light to wouldbe shooters who pervert silence into endorsement  there will a lot of similar sentiments today especially from members of congress whove been pushing this issue  certainly an important part of the investigation again it goes to a lot of the issues that weve talked about for a long time here and that is gun possession and gun rights and certainly that will come up probably no doubt in this case  guns are probably not that hard to get despite the laws in place what does it tell you that this young man 17 years old  all right joining us here with reaction former deputy assistant to the president and fox news national security strategist dr sebastian gorka and author of the bestselling book geraldo show and fox news correspondentatlarge geraldo rivera  geraldo you have agreed with me this is we have to solve this i dont want to report this anymore and the way to do it is every school in america gets a full security threat assessment every single school in america has a perimeter check points of entry must be monitored an id system metal detectors and every floor of every school two concealed carry armed retired military or police that will stop it that is not political geraldo  it isnt   and i agree with you brother on how we have to solve this problem what is very very clear harshly clear is the thoughts and prayers dont cut it anymore we are facing an epidemic this is the 16th schoolrelated shooting this year  there is a perverse phenomenon copycat going on if we can protect our money in banks   we have said this before if we can protect our airliners for god sakes we have to protect their school children what does that mean that means having the armed resource officers on the scene  but in this case we have to be frank about this there were two heroic cops on the scene both of them wounded as far as i can understand  yes  even the chief arrived firing his weapon at the alleged perpetrator the 17yearold kid we have to do more we have to have one entrance to the schools i think that dan patrick the lieutenant governor of texas was absolutely right we have to have controlled access  we have to have as in many new york city and other urban districts have metal detectors metal detectors  everywhere  if we can do it on an airliner why cant we do it to protect our precious children but we have to stop the rhetoric stop the finger pointing lets do something  the president has to lead us   he has to tell us this is what we have to do maybe it is local jurisdiction but i want federal oversight of every school  you know   one rule for every school the children are the most precious resource if thats just not a bunch of bs then we have to do something about this awful ugly phenomenon thats going on    dr gorka we know how to do this because we do rightly so protect our politicians we protect athletes and we have never had an incident at the oscars armed security threat assessment points of entry perimeter control and people armed again concealed carry on scene every floor and every school and yes the metal detectors  yes this is not a complicated problem to solve geraldo is half right number one we secure federal buildings we secure control banks this is controlled access to the most precious thing we have in our country which is our children  however i vehemently disagree dont expect uncle sam to fix this for you its not about reinforcing the attitudes of the nanny state this should be done at the local level if the local school council cant sort this out if the local municipality or the government cant sort this out its not going to be federal government that sorts it out but controlled access is the key  how about this how about we give every police officer retired that would volunteer two or three days a week every retired military that would volunteer every two or three days a week how about we give them no federal no state no local taxes none  that would be insignificant in terms of the cost if we did it that way all right thank you both sad day our thoughts and prayers with the families again this has got to stop  when we come back white house press secretary sarah sanders on the medias current credibility crisis which is major stay with us  all right fake news cnns credibility continues to be called into question today in an interview on the liberal network president trumps attorney rudy giuliani called out the entire network for their blatant bias watch this  does the president ever get the benefit of the doubt with you chris ever or on this network which is disgusting  rudy actually i would tell you something i think he gets the benefit of the doubt much more often than you give us credit for  do you know that most people think im crazy to come on here  why  that its so unfair to the president  do you think this interview has been unfair  yes i do  you think the interview has been unfair  absolutely  why  because i dont think you dont give me a chance to explain how injustice this case is i dont think youve given me a chance to explain the basis of it with the fbi report that was faulty the fbi that came to the conclusion  i dont understand how a man can be prosecuted when you come to a conclusion he hasnt done anything wrong  i mean how can you investigate a man when you come a conclusion who hasnt done anything wrong you guys never  you didnt play up that part of the report  rudy giuliani is right fake news cnn basically never gives this president a fair shake they never will they are not even honest about it now for example earlier this week cnn trumphater the official trump hater supposedly a reporter supposedly objective jim acosta he goes on jimmy kimmel live and he said he was just as tough on obama as he is on president trump its not a joke take a look  are you their least favorite of all  probably you know as fdr once said i welcome their hatred  you do  i do and you know listen when i covered barack obama i was just as tough on him people might not believe that  you were dating like weve  they didnt like me either  youre universally disliked  i am yes  everywhere you go  so acosta can actually say that with a straight face is beyond me because the tapes dont lie and our friends with the media research center they found this gem of jim acosta covering president obamas inauguration in 2013 the only thing missing from the socalled reporter are the pom poms take a look  and obviously this is the moment that everybody is waiting for on inauguration day when the president and the first lady step out of their limo and walk down pennsylvania avenue you know i feel like i should pinch myself right now wolf i cant believe i have this vantage point of history in the making  so you are literally what 15 20 feet away from the president  im probably a good i would say 50 feet away from the president right now wolf were very very close  yes with obama he needs to pinch himself and he says he is a reporter he says he is a journalist no he is a liberal activist be honest about it  now brother i spoke with white house press secretary sarah sanders about this and so much more  all right sarah thank you for joining us you look at all of what im pointing out here i dont think there has ever been a more hostile news media in the country than there has been of president trump i think its obvious its so bad that there is 91 percent negative coverage according to the media research center  its unreal the amount of negative coverage that comes from the media covering this white house not just because its so onesided but because there are so many good things they could be talking about  the economy is booming isis is on the run remaking of the judiciary getting rid of the individual mandate the foreign policy and the relationship that this president has built every day there is a good news story to tell and yet 90 percent of the coverage is negative    one of the clips that i hope that youll go back and watch that i think jim acosta also said from that interview was that he would love to go one on one with president trump i have just little note to jim  i think he should stick with going oneonone with me because president trump is way out of his league and i dont think he wants to take on that challenge because hes definitely not going to win i think that the media bias is out of control and he certainly one of the leaders of the pack  look if he wants to be an opinion person im a talk show host and as a talk show host sometimes i do straight news interviews and sometimes i give opinion other times i moderate debate and sometimes i debate its all encompassing  but i tell everybody im a conservative we still do a lot we break frankly we break more stories than most of them in a week than they do in a year in my opinion and theyve been wrong so often  why  why does this continue in this set every day i watch you i dont know how you do your job i could not  there is not enough money on this earth to pay me to do what you do and its actually gotten personal and abusive and have we gotten to the point where maybe they should submit their questions in writing and hand back written answers because what they are really trying to do is get a moment so they can show their audiences how tough they are and its really show time for them its not about getting answers  look i do my job because i love this country and i love getting to come to work every day and work for president trump who also loves this country and wants to do good things you can block out the critics and focus on the people across the country that love the president and love what he is going  and we try to spend our energy focused on those comments and the people and the voices coming from outside of dc and outside of new york and outside of the talking heads because those are the people that really matter and those are certainly overwhelmingly supporting president trump and what hes done and that makes it pretty easy to come to work every day  you know look at this week the president was answering a question about the violent violent gang known as ms13 it was obvious the media ran with it and then they ended up almost all of them having to retract it there is a lot of retracting that they really need to do though  its incredible a lot of times you see the media just automatically assume the worst out of this president which is really sad because again i think they are missing out on some of the most amazing things that are happening he has had an incredible first year and a half and they are missing that because they are so focused on being negative and attacking not just the president but everyone around him  and i think thats a real disservice to the country he clearly was talking about ms13 when he referenced the animals and i said it yesterday ill say it again i think he could have gone further  i agree  these are some of the most despicable people that have ever walked this planet the things that they do the type of activity they engage in animal is the nicest thing i think that the president could have called them and i hope hell continue to call them out and continue to put pressure on every law enforcement agency and official in this country to bring them down and protect people across all over the country and certainly i think he has done a great job doing that  all right sarah great job i dont know how you do it every day amazing we appreciate you being with us and she is right fourteen states record low unemployment record low unemployment for african american hispanics for women lets see  kept his promise on jerusalem got out of the iranian deal and look at whats happening with little rocket man just touching the surface all right were not done  when we come back were going to talk more about the director of national intelligence under barack obama well take james clapper to task does he not believe in the rule of law or constitution it appears he doesnt the fbi had a spy in the trump campaign where is the one in hillarys thats next  life from the americas news headquarters im trace gallagher  ten people are dead another 10 more wounded in a mass shooting early this morning at santa fe high school in texas the alleged shooter 17yearold dimitrios pagourtzis has been charged with capital murder and he is being held with no bond  texas congressman michael mccaul chair of the house homeland security committee says federal prosecutors are also considering weapons of mass destruction charges for the explosive devices found at the scene  texas governor greg abbott says he will organize round tables around the state to discuss preventing further shootings  and president trump has now activated his gun safety commission thats the group he convened in the wake of the parkland school shooting in florida back february the white house declined to say if the president would revisit gun control measures proposed after the shooting  when news breaks out well break in im trace gallagher now back to    all right as we continue on   tonight more reaction to james clappers stunning admission we have joining us from american conservative union chairman matt schlapp and by the way she also serves on the presidents media advisory board radio tv talk host dr gina loudon good to see you both  dr loudon look to me this is a simple do we have a duel system of justice in this country the clinton system versus everybody else and are we going to spy and get fisa warrants on every campaign or send that fbi informant without any warrant  gina loudon member trump 2020  you know   as you pointed out many times on your show this is really more  i mean if all the crimes were happening it wouldnt be such a big deal because the american people would know about it if the media were reporting it fairly  and i want to put this in perspective imagine for a moment if during watergate for example the media had been covering up for the things that happened during watergate thats not the case in this particular instance the media is covering up for the criminals in this and conspired against the american voter to undermine an entire election we need to let that sink in as an american people and we need to fight it on every level  matt its not only the fisa abuse i mean think about this unverified uncorroborated clinton bought and paid for foreign national put together christopher steele russian lies to influence an election bad enough then it becomes the bulk of information never verified never tell the judges four times she paid for it now we have a spy in the trump campaign  ok this is not the united states if this is allowed to stand  yes thats right i think the worst part is that we have been covering this throughout the entire trump presidency and really even during at the end of the campaign and there is still confusion about what our government did to try to undermine and influence the presidential election  you got to repeat that to yourself a couple of times and let it sink in this is a constitutional crisis you know i watched this interview with clapper on that show that i wont mention because i hate it so much i also watched mark levin on your show and i think mark has this exactly right which is this is a constitutional crisis  i advise the president to do what ronald reagan did he picked a tower commission he picked three imminent experts in the field of foreign policy  yes   and they came up with solutions that the country needs to implement immediately  and dr loudon i cant imagine what the reaction would be if they spied on the hillary campaign and she actually was paying for russian lies  right again if they had done all of this if anything in this were fair   from the things that have taken place in a totally hypocritical manner by the left  yes   by the powers that the government agencies but then the media never reporting it accurately   and giving these federal agencies permission essentially to go ahead  unbelievable   and to cover the whole thing up in hindsight its horrible it is a constitutional crisis  last word matt  you know the american people are getting the joke here they know that there were abuses and the presidents numbers are getting better and better because when the media picks on him the american people are fair and they are coming to his side  well said both of you all right good to see you both  thank you  when we come back rush limbaugh he weighs in on james clappers incredibly stunning admission thats next as we continue  all right our video of the day yes the number one radio host in the country rush limbaugh sounding off on the news that james clapper said its a good thing if the fbi had a spy in the trump campaign wow take a listen  the fbi gains a lot of valuable information from informants  ok i will tell you what ill tell you what then clapper whoever you people run in 2020 were going to put a spy were going to  its going to be a valuable thing were going to find out who it is it might be trying to rig the election for you  if the russians tampering with campaigns is the big deal you clapper say its not trump no no this is hyperbole we were trying to find out what the russians were doing because the russians are  you people have done more to damage the integrity of the american electoral process than vladimir putin could do in his dreams and im not joking  all right great point by rush as usual all right thats all the time we have left this ev'"

       "\"     close      video      strassel chaffetz on claims of trump campaign surveillance the wall street journal's kimberly strassel and fox news contributor jason chaffetz weigh in on ' '     this is a rush transcript from   may 21 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated  yes can we pan and a little they have us back so far i can't even see  where are you  if we could just pan in james and help us out here it's too far away come on come on in that's all right don't worry people at home understand is a live television thank you tucker  good luck man  great show as always     all right welcome to    tonight this is unbelievable the deep state should be totally terrified as all of their nefarious deeds that we have been telling you have been exposed  this is the worst abuse of power corruption scandal in american history it is all coming out everything we have been telling you the president rightly demanding to know just how pervasive this playing was on his campaign and who in the obama administration was involved  rod rosenstein he is responding he's telling the doj inspector general he can investigate this is only providing cover for his deep state friends and trying to delay what will be inevitable bad idea i will tell you why  also the media and even hillary clinton's former top campaign aide for decades mark penn are now starting to admit what a huge abuse of power scandal this is  and also tonight we have all of these deep state actors john brennan james clapper sally yates all melting down over these spy revelations so in desperation they are predictably looking lashing out at president trump it's not going to work  and also tonight a bombshell report from our own sara carter the fisa memos that the doj is refusing to hand over could very well hold the key to the obama fbi trump surveillance  now we've got a lot to go stay with us for the hour this is an important breaking news opening monologue  after a meeting between trump the fbi director chris wray rod rosenstein other top intel officials the white house is saying president trump and the department of justice are now asking the inspector general to investigate the obama administration and the spying they did on the trump campaign  and the white house is also revealing tonight that chief of staff john kelly general kelly is setting up a meeting for congress so they will see the documents that constitutionally they have been asking for and the doj has been obstructing and stonewalling really i'll believe it when i see those documents  this is the same material that rod rosenstein has refused to turn over for months his name by the way you want to keep an eye on i'll have more on rosenstein in a minute  first what's unfolding about the deep state is so dramatic so i shocking but of the same time so very predictable given everything we have now been uncovering for over 18 months we are now seeing the cracks in the deep state in this dam it's about to burst and all of this information is now beginning to cascade out  even the new york times the washington post are now confirming just in the last week everything we have been uncovering again for 18 months it is the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal that makes watergate look like a parking ticket  the house intel committee chair devin nunes he is reacting by saying this is crossing a serious redline very important  if they ran a spy ring or an informant ring and they were paying people within the trump campaign if any of that is true that is an absolute redline there is not an honest person in this country that thinks it's ok if sources informants whatever you want to call them go around and start passing out money all over the globe to do what to secretly put yourself into a presidential campaign that's not acceptable in this country  that's not acceptable in the united states of america chairman nunes is also saying there might be more than one fbi informant you have got to be kidding me  watch this  nobody was ever interested in an informant we ask for specific documents that we still have not received from the department of justice so they continue to leak out things about this informant and we don't know if there is one informant or more informants because there is so much out there now it's really getting tough to follow all we are asking for is give us the documentation that you used just for this investigation  hand it over these type of tactics spying in an opposition party in an election year are you kidding me this is what you would see the former soviet union venezuela not the united states of america  just look at this quote from the wall street journal editorial board listen to this 'we cannot recall a similar case even in the j edgar hoover days when the fbi decided it needed to snoop on a presidential campaign' this is the same j edgar hoover who was notorious for having files on just about everyone and washington that is how serious all of this is  even clinton aide and adviser mark penn who's worked with the clintons for 20 years is calling out the scandal for what it is this is a gamechanging moment and penn has worked for the clinton's forever and served as hillary's chief strategist for her campaign in 2008  he is now calling this witch hunt for what it is and literally writing an oped in the hill 'stopping robert mueller to protect us all' stunning headline  penn goes on to explain how the facts are now undeniable mueller is on a crusade to get the president of the united states to overturn a duly elected president he uses the term deep state that it's real that the fbi rigged the clinton investigation and been targeted donald trump and his campaign when he was presidentelect and now president  and penn explained more on this on the story with martha maccallum earlier tonight take a look  i think the inspector general's report is coming out i think nunes is finding out what were the origins of the investigation and there doesn't seem to be a real concrete intelligence origin for this investigation and without a foundation one wonders what did we spend an entire year on what did we disrupt everyone who was of a campaign everyone who in the administration  and also former solicitor general for the us ted olson he's out with a new piece where he explains how robert mueller's witch hunt could be setting up a massive constitutional crisis  and of course investigative reporter sharyl attkisson she has a defining piece and all of this literally called the collusion against trump  an entire timeline she breaks down every single key moment in this entire massive abuse of power scandal we will refer to this throughout history because it's been going on for 18 months  the mainstream media even they finally are starting to catch on and admit that what we have been reporting and what others on the show have been reporting and other people what we have been covering we are now being proven right they have to admit it look at this headline from the washington post over the weekend secret fbi source for russia investigation met with three trump advisors during the campaign  here's a usa today report look at this cover it says and even by the way even fake news liberal cnn they can't ignore all of the facts all the evidence ok it's taking them well over a year but finally the media starting to realize that they have missed the single biggest story in their lifetime as they pursued russia russia stormy  it's a massive abuse of power we first reported on this march 7th 2017 about fisa surveillance of the trump campaign president trump he has every single right tonight to be outraged about what has happened he has every right to want to know the truth  you the american people need to know the truth we need to expose all of this criminal behavior all of these deep state actors need to be exposed and all of them held accountable the deputy attorney general rod rosenstein ok he's quick to respond to president trump demanding the department of justice get to the bottom of it all  so rosenstein is trying to make himself hard to be a hero but it's a total farce here's why rosenstein is doing what he always does and that is protecting all of his deep state friends  the deputy attorney general he knows that by referring this to be inspector general it will buy them a year to 18 months and protect all of these deep state actors it's going to take michael horowitz well over a year  we don't have over a year to uncover this we need a full fbi doj rank and file field office investigation into all of this because what they are trying to do is slowly leak out this information a slow bleed to cover themselves it's all a cya  and remember they know what's out there they know they are about to get caught this is all about controlling the narrative spinning the narrative trying to protect themselves and they probably learned a thing or two from hillary about acid washing hard drives we've got to be careful  there is another major component to all of this rosenstein knows that the inspector general he doesn't have any real prosecutorial power horowitz can't convene a grand jury he cannot indict people he can only give criminal referrals like in the case of andrew mccabe and on top of all of that as we are seeing with this ig report on the clinton email investigation the fbi the doj both get to review and try and refute facts and redact information again probably falsely and the name of national security  we have been saying congress needs to see these documents we have checks and balances separation of powers coequal branches of government and you know what they are purposely obstructed and it looks like some of this might start to happen  sara carter she'll join us in a few minutes breaking another exclusive story tonight here's the headline  'concealed fisa documents may hold the key to trump's surveillance' what sara is reporting a number of very key details that rod rosenstein he signed the final fisa warrant you know using the fake phony dossier as the bulk of information why to spy on trump campaign associate carter page using the unverified never corroborated clinton bought and paid for foreign national put together dossier of russian lies  sara is also reporting that back in april the fbi refused to turn over documents that chairman nunes and others have been asking for you know phony claims of national security risks and as we have seen it is one excuse to stonewall after another all to prevent congress from knowing the truth and fulfilling their constitutional role  and chairman nunes well he is now putting his foot down in this standoff with rosenstein and the doj good for devin nunes take a look  we had a productive  what i thought was a productive meeting and then after that meeting they've done nothing n but leak and leak and leak now we don't know exactly who it is over at the department of justice or fbi i'm not pinning any blame on people but we're not going to go to another meeting where we don't get documents and then the meeting leaks out  the chairman is getting close the entire truth is now starting to come out thankfully by the way despite rosenstein stonewalling and because of all of these developments you have deep state actors former communistvoting john brennan how we ever became cia director is beyond any comprehension i have we know no liar james clapper sally yates we know her political agenda they are losing their minds because all of them are about to be exposed  brennan lashing out at president trump tweeting  senator mcconnell speaker ryan if mr trump continues along this disastrous path you will bear major responsibility for the harm to our democracy by the way we are a republic you do a great disservice to the nation and the republican party if you continue to enable mr trump's selfserving actions  brennan is off to his eyeballs in all this i'm certain that will be exposed as we've been saying on this program he has been lying about his involvement with this clinton bought and paid for dossier four months and he lied in front of congress  and as for james clapper he is ensnared in the dossier scandal also clapper oh what is his response just like yates just like brennan let's go after the president and attack him  that's actually a very disturbing assault on the independence of the department of justice and i think when the president this president or any president tries to use the department of justice as kind of the private investigatory body that's not good for the country  the big thing here this is not about spying on his campaign it's about what the russians are doing were they attempting to infiltrate the campaign that was a concern and that was in my belief is what focus of this whole activity was about  the same clapper who bragged about the fbi spying on the trump campaign and said it was a good thing this is problematic  and then there's good old sally yates who signed off on yes one of the fisa warrants like rosenstein and was emailing with andrew weissmann the most corrupt member of mueller's team after she refused to enforce the travel ban yates was also trashing the president why to save and protect yourself  watch this  donald trump himself accusing the obama administration of improperly targeting his campaign for an investigation what is your response to everything you've heard over the weekend  well obviously i'm not going to comment on the specific facts that's really up to the department of justice to decide on what information should b percent be made public with respect to that but i think what we are seeing here is the president has just taken his allout assault on the rule of law to a new level and this time he is ordering an investigation of the investigators who are examining his own campaign you know that's really shocking  what a hardhitting interview by liberal joe  all three of these deep state players are scared out of their minds they are directly implicated in all this it is time to ask what do they all know when they all know it  and just like i've been saying about their deep state friend james comey who by the way james i warned you you have the right to remain silent you didn't listen anyway instead of running their mouths well they might want to lawyer up and many of them are yes james comey hired three lawyers three people he leaked documents too great attorneyclient privilege for everyone but me  another big development to tell you about tonight the soontobe released doj ig report on the clinton email server investigation is expected to slam fbi leaders just like comey andrew mccabe for taking weeks to review emails that were found on huma abedin's shared computer with anthony weiner  and the ig report is supposed to come out very soon and if the inspector general horowitz does his job and his 500 employees comey and mccabe should be very worried tonight  all right a lot of ground to cover joining us now fox news contributor sara carter former us attorney for the district of columbia joe digenova  i said to you last time joe when you were on this program i cringe my mom was a prison guard my dad worked in family court probation i have so many extended family members in the nypd and the fbi  and you say bad cops i know the 99 percent are not they are good people for this country but we know tonight you have been right and what we have been reporting sara included she has been right  well i think the sad thing about this is he watched someone like sally yates who was the deputy attorney general under obama and acting attorney general for a while complain about the rule of law and the violation of it when she and brennan and comey and others destroyed the rule of law in the obama administration  they introduced it they besmirched it to they were so politically motivated that they have now destroyed the department of justice and the fbi it is going to take a decade to rebuild the public trust in the fbi and the department of justice because sally yates who just joined a fancy law firm in atlanta is going to need to lawyer up  the disgraceful performance of her and of course even more disgraceful john brennan who led a conspiracy against a campaign of the opposing party's presidential nominee and then when he won them i did everything could to frame him and his compatriots with false crimes it is the greatest political scandal in american history and shame on sally yates and shame on john brennan  wow it's such a powerful commentary and sadly it's all true  sara carter march 7th 2017 you and john solomon right here on this show broke the news about the trump campaign being surveilled you are now saying that concealed the fisa documents the warrants the original applications the bulk of information as the nunes and grassleygraham memo said came from that phony dossier that hillary paid for and they lied to fisa judges how are those documents and i hear there are other documents if they are ever released will expose all of it which is why the ig report to me is a bad idea or going the ig route is a bad idea  i think going with ig is fine as long as the documents are turned over and that's what's important here now these documents are associated with the fisa applications  remember they were focused fisa and applications starting in october 21st 2016 and then it rolled all the way to september 2017 that sevenmonths into president trump's administration and these were all on carter page but they also brought in a dragnet of everybody that carter page spoke to and possibly people that those people spoke to  now there was evidence attached to these fisa applications remember it's not just the dossier there was other extenuating evidence that was attached these are probably part of the documents that they are requesting  remember this was a classified letter that nunes sent no one has seen it what is important now   is that they get those documents because the house intelligence committee and the senate judiciary committee are far ahead  well there is something called bleach bit that nobody in america knew about except for hillary clinton  that's right these are held on servers that are highly guarded and protected at the fbi and i don't believe  i'm not 100 percent positive that this could be destroyed what i know they need to do is show those documents without reductions  and they need to have people in there that understand what's going on they need to have people inside that can actually read the document not just congressional leaders i know that john kelly is going to be setting up the meeting but i hope that the president got confirmation from both rod rosenstein and christopher wray that they will be delivering those documents and i hope that the appropriate investigators with the right clearance are able to get into this meeting and examine those documents  i hope the president is demanding because he has the power to demand it and the power to see it unredacted and the power also to declassify it if need be  joe so much  by the way i told sara last week  sara am i going to recognize the initials of the informant yes we all recognize them i thought i was being clever  bu now we are discovering two separate reports that he got paid in a two year period of time between  400000 and maybe a million maybe as a high as a million we also learned from devin nunes we might have a second spy on a presidential candidate i read the wall street journal but now you got people like ted olson who everyone respects former solicitor general mark penn sharyl attkisson's timeline is devastating to the entire story the entire narrative  your reaction to all of this  well here's the thing i  you know inspector generals are good in certain circumstances  here's the problem with mr horowitz he cannot interview any of the people who have led the department of justice or fbi he has no subpoena authority  so all of the people who were part of the plot and were in doj and the fbi are gone he can't talk to them all he can do is review documents and talk to whoever is left to do that  what we need is a federal grand jury with a prosecutor doesn't have to be a special counsel and by the way let's remember why we are here we are here because rod rosenstein a political coward someone who was inadvertently made deputy attorney general appointed robert mueller illegally with no evidence that any crime had been committed  and here we are more than a year later with nothing having been determined except that there was no russian collusion all of these people having been put through hell because rod rosenstein couldn't do what he should have done  and he's conflicted   which is having conducted  not only is he conflicted because he was a witness and he signed some of the warrants guess what suppose there was activity which i believe there was that went beyond the law rod rosenstein is not only a witness he would be a coconspirator i mean this is ludicrous when you  when you think that the president of the united states has to demand an investigation into something that is so obviously criminal and now the chief of staff general kelly is telling rod rosenstein show them the documents  is joe right about rod rosenstein we have about 35 seconds sara  i believe joe is right about rod rosenstein i mean he has been stonewalling congress he has been stonewalling everyone on the release of documents over and over again and this time i believe that nunes and the rest of them mean it if they take this next meeting he better bring those documents he better bring so they can see them that's about the right people can have access  i hear if he brings them he signing his own demise  well he signed that last fisa warrant  that's right i want to see it you're right  let's hope so let's hope  you guys have been amazing thank you for your hard work  when we come back ed henry more details of the president's meeting with rosenstein and wray and newt gingrich and much more straight ahead  joining us live from the white house more details of the president's high stakes meeting with the deputy attorney general rod rosenstein the fbi director fox news chief national correspondent ed henry  ed i won't believe the documents are coming until they are sent    there's a lot of skepticism about that tonight especially when you have people like sally yates remember ousted from the justice department last year saying today that she believes the president is launching an allout assault on democracy by pressuring the justice department to put these documents out there but also investigate what happened with this confidential informant  but i can tell you republicans like devin nunes are pushing back tonight saying that sally yates and other obama officials are just trying to divert attention from the real story that in the words of nunes a bright red line was crossed when the fbi allegedly infiltrated the trump campaign and allegedly spied on it that meeting you mentioned the president with rod rosenstein christopher wray the fbi director they basically  the president was demanding a new investigation to find out just how this pressure probe started the president it appears got some concrete action  press secretary sarah sanders telling us quote  based on the meeting with president the department of justice has asked the department addresses to expand its current investigation to include any irregularities with the fbi's or the department of justice's tactics concerning the trump campaign it also agreed that white house chief of staff john kelly will immediately set up a meeting with the fbi doj and director of national intelligence with congressional leaders to review highly classified and other information they have requested  now that means john kelly will be working with nunes and others to get the documents that nunes has demanding for weeks now about this confidential informant nunes saying there needs to be transparency as democrats like adam schiff object  this is a dramatic end to new and destructive low i think for the congress of the united states basically to ignore the warnings of the fbi and justice department and potentially risk people's lives what they would like this information for is clearly to be of service to the trump defense team and further any narrative they have  we don't know if there is one informant or more informants because there is so much out there now it's really getting tough to follow all we are asking for is give us the documentation that you used to start this investigation  now fox news also learning tonight that this longawaited justice department inspector general report looking at the fbi and the justice department's handling of the hillary clinton email investigation has found among other things that james comey and andy mccabe his former number two at the fbi of course who was also ousted acted improperly but not moving quickly enough on those emails that appeared in september of 2016 they didn't look into them look into the the new clinton emails found on anthony wiener's laptop of course until october 2016  that and the whole bunch of other things now under scrutiny which showed   that it's not just the handling of the trump investigation but the handling of the clinton investigation by the doj and the fbi still very much under investigation right now    deep state is being exposed mueller's witch hunt is crashing in this a fascinating times great report ed henry at the white house  joining us now wall street journal's kimberley strassel she was the first journalist to expose this huge scandal nearly two weeks ago that in fact the fbi use an informant to spy in the trump campaign she joins us as well as fox news contributor jason chaffetz  you know i love the wall street journal and their comments in their editorial kimberley i thought it was devastating and also the calls on the obama administration the call on obama what did he know and when did he knew it and now nunes saying kimberley there might be a second spy  yes this is really important first of all for people to remember that the department of justice which is now out there hinting and various partisans like adam schiff that somehow congressman nunes and others are responsible for blowing this source  the department of justice leaked all of these details to friendly news media sources everything short of this guy's name and his social security number  bingo  and just so that they could get ahead of this and spin it the way they wanted to because they knew the news was tightening and they probably be forced to put out these documents and this is the other important part too none of us have had enough information on yet is we know a lot about what the fbi did although still not enough what we don't know though is what the political side of this operation knew  we know clinton's campaign had this dossier too who else had it in the obama administration and what other agencies were involved in efforts to go after the trump campaign prior to the fbi's claim of its official start of its investigation  i won't  i'll say it so i don't want to bring former congressman chaffetz schiff is the biggest liar and propagandist on television to almost as bad as fake news cnn and conspiracy tv msnbc bigger points here the fbi paid this guy we've all known his name for a long time this is not  they've leaked it they're the ones that did it  but paying this guy money and maybe a second spy and i don't believe they're going to hand over the documents if they can get away with it congressman chaffetz you requested some of the very same information well over a year ago and it's never been forthcoming  yes there's a subpoena issued in 2016 for all the documents that we wanted to see the inspector general can get these documents if he hasn't already i hope he's already gathered them up i think the deep state is understanding that the truth is going to surface and that's why they're leaking this information to friendly news sources to put their own spin on it  i think kim strassel has done the best reporting on that i have to tell you you have an attorney general in jeff sessions who is there in name only he's worthless and you have rod rosenstein who is there with an oxygen mask he's totally conflicted  and i'm excited with some members in the house are going to do tomorrow i think there's a group of five members that will actually put forward a resolution to say we need a second special counsel  i hear that rod rosenstein has a vicious temper and right now is on edge everyday screaming at people have you heard that congressman  it isn't pretty over there i mean it's amazing if you look at what rod rosenstein is arguing and then you look at the democrats like adam schiff this political hack that is just so desperate not to have the truth to come out  shiftless schiff  yes i mean he doesn't want to have truth come out he doesn't want to expose what's going on there  no it's the propaganda  devin nunes is part of the gang of eight he can look at all that information  last word and i agree with congressman chaffetz you've done a great job kimberly last word  look the other thing this has to be declassified congress needs to see it first but then every one of us need to see it too  the president can do that correct  yes  yes and i think that needs to be accepted  and the president can demand they turn them over now correct  yes  yes  the president he's the president of the united states  that's correct  the only constitutionally elected person and he can declassify it  now so  i would say to the president do it now  yes  do not waste 18 months for the ig to investigate with 500 people and then we'll find out later they'll do everything they can to spin it lie delete thank you all  thank you  when we come back former speaker of the house newt gingrich weighs in on tonight's big breaking news stay with us  to give us reaction to tonight's big breaking news author of the upcoming book it's going to be out june 5 and available for preorder now on barnes and noblecom  com it's called trump's america  the truth about our nation's big comeback former speaker of the house and fox news contributor i want to talk about your book but not now this  sorry i love you you're my  you're family to me  but when you look at this and ted olson and mark penn and sharyl attkisson and now even the new york times and washington post well trying to get ahead of what they fell to do for a year and a half and the deep state is real and the effort to undermine the president is real fisa abuses real spies in the trump campaign are real you're the great historian tell me where this  where in history this will stack up to  well i think it's rapidly becoming the biggest and the most sobering political scandal in american history somebody pointed out earlier you know back when j edgar hoover was spying on lyndon johnson's behest on richard nixon we thought it was terrible back when they had a break in at the watergate we thought it was terrible  this is a multiyear effort that has two different fronts people need to always remember that one front was protecting propping up covering up for bill and hillary clinton the other front as trump became more and more serious the other front was to stop trump at any cost  now i believe that the reason you see people like sally yates go berserk you see john brennan go berserk you see general clapper go berserk they're all guilty when you see someone in the obama team who gets that rattled and as that angry which you know is they're scared to death that they're going to get drawn into all this  and their role is going to come out and it will involve i think felonies and frankly i suspect it reaches to president obama it's inconceivable that president obama could have had this many things going on and not known it because his administration was very controlling and very tight and i think we're going to discover all of the stuff in the end ends up with the obama white house and has the president and his senior staff's fingerprints all over it  the question remains what did he know what did kerry what did susan rice and ben rhodes know  sure  what did clapper and brennan know we only haven't talked about unmasking but you're right hillary gets a rigged investigation and then comes the effort to undermine a president or candidate then a president elect and then the president of the united states you put spies and you lie to court you lie to fisa judges  i think the number one thing the average everyday american can take from all this is that the corruption was so deep at the top and again remember we're not talking about the everyday fbi agent doing their job we're talking about people at the very top and those people were so corrupt and so arrogant that they thought they could get away with anything  and so they just proceeded down the road protecting hillary covering up hillary giving immunity to people who are breaking the law and then going after trump and going after trump supporters when all of this comes out as one in a way that's easy to understand which may take frankly another year or a year and a half because there's so much of it  and every time we turn around as you know another piece unravels and you had more big stories in the last year and a half than i would have thought possible and again and again you've been right and inch by inch even the new york times is starting to concede  and i think by the way mark penn's column today is a real breakthrough because here you have a genuine unqualified member of the left saying this is a threat to all of us and we have got to get rid of mueller because he literally threatens every american's freedom  mr speaker you understand the constitution you understand checks and balances separation of powers constitutional authority oversight of congress how dare rod rosenstein who already is conflicted in this by recommending the firing of comey and signing one of the fisa warrants how dare they not turn this over to congress but that's what they have done what should congress do you're a former speaker  well for me first of all i think it's beginning to move in the right direction i think the president is beginning to weigh in to reinforce the republicans in congress i think you  general kelly being given this assignment is a very tough very serious man and i think he's going to impose on the justice department doing their job of turning over legitimate appropriate information to the legislative branch  but everybody ought to remember now you mentioned the constitution remember that when they were done writing it benjamin franklin was asked by a woman you know what have we got and he said we have a republic if we can keep it this is one of those great tests in american history corruption came close to destroying the liberties you and i believe in  and if hillary got elected none of this would have come out scary mr speaker we appreciate your perspective as always i promise will be promoting your book i know it's going to be great i haven't seen it yet  all right when we  what when we come back all right former obama cia director communist supporter john brennan's recent comments about president trump have been completely unhinged michelle malkin daniel hoffman they weighin next on this big news night stay with us  the president is taking aim at former cia director john brennan on twitter now this after brennan has attacked the president with outrageous accusations totally political take a look  i think he's afraid of the president of russia  why  well i think one can speculate as to why that the russians may have something on him personally but the fact that he has had this fawning attitude toward mr putin he's not said anything negative about him i think continues tom you know say to me that he does have something to fear  i think mr putin is very clever in terms of playing to mr trump's interest in being flattered and also i think mr trump is for whatever reason either intimidated by mr putin afraid of what he could do or what might come out  here with reaction she's the host of crtv her own show of course michelle malkin and by the way it's awardwinning and retired cia senior intelligence officer fox news contributor daniel hoffman  because this is about brennan i know more people more people that worked in your line of work that think that he is the absolute worst director we've ever had and this display of politics and whatever involvement people we now see coming his lying under oath like clapper people have had it that i know fbi intelligence and of course law enforcement  his tweets today read like a partisan politician not a nonpartisan retired former director of cia i would highlight the contrast between brennan's tweets and his unfounded allegations about the president speculation that vladimir putin could blackmail president trump contrast that with president trump today at cia headquarters presiding over the swearingin ceremony of gina haspel he called cia officers the most elite intelligence professionals on the planet  she's a hero to me i thank god just like mike pompeo thank god they did what they did we would have never gotten bin laden  let me turn to you michelle malkin from your perspective you see this abuse of power you see this deep state corruption and you're wondering as sure as i am how could this happen in this country but it did and it's now unraveling  yes it did and that is why people like john brennan are behaving the way they're behaving completely unhinged as you say i think that john brennan is a bilious blabber mouth bilious full of vial contempt in spite not just for our president but for our country and for the american people who duly elected this president so i think  i want to know what he knew and when  exactly  i want to know what his involvement is  and i think it's going to come out and i think that's why he panicked over the weekend and i think that there is a small difference between being a spook a partisan spook for obama and being a crook and he is definitely i think cringing in the spotlight  i think that daniel hoffman was right too when he observed that the kind of comments that he has made publicly about president trump aren't just something that harm the white house but harm all of the good people within the cia who are trying to do their jobs as this man is selfaggrandizing  so true  and you can see the psychological projection here of john brennan using words like selfadoring and selfserving to describe our president when he is describing himself i mean if this guy had done his job during the obama administration we wouldn't have all of the bungles that john brennan was been tangled everything from helping design the lies about the benghazi video bungling the investigation of the chris  the fast and furious  right the fast and furious irs the christmas the underwear bomber and then going so far as to downplaying recidivism of the gitmo terrorists and being soft on jihad the fact is that these guys have been so invested in their ideological agenda and their partisanship that they were not doing their job and protecting americans around the world and at home  you know i mean this with all my heart i've been  and michelle has too the biggest defender of law enforcements my entire career i want to remind people this is not rank and file intelligence cia fbi this is not in any way shape manner or form it's the upper echelon and  and john brennan is doing vladimir putin's bidding and for someone who has criticized the trump administration for the way they've handled russia even though the trump administration has closed down russian consulate in seattle and san francisco and kicked out 60 russian officials i think john brennan is doing what vladimir putin wants by speculating about the president being subjected to blackmail even though it's not true and brennan walked it back with the new york times the days after he said but the damage is done  the damage is done last 15 seconds michelle  yes the biggest threat we face right now is the threeheaded hydra of the police state the deep state and the fourth state all the insatia ph was relationships the leaks and the selfprofiteering by people like john brennan and his ilk  all right thank you both thank you so much when we come back hillary clinton unbelievably embarrassed herself we'll show you next  all right hillary she can't seem to move on from her election loss in 2016 this past weekend commencement speech at yale university the poor kids have already been indoctrinated clinton just really embarrassed herself yet again it's cringe worthy  i see looking out at you that you are following the tradition of overthetop hats so i brought i had too a russian hat  right look i mean if you can't beat them join them  hillary you're still the loser and number two hillary you paid for russian government lies christopher steele funneled money fusion gps and they turned out to be false even the interrogatory steele said only 50 50 it's wrong  all right let not your night be troubled there she  why did you
